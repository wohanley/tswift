title: 22

It feels like a perfect night  
To dress up like hipsters  
And make fun of our exes  
It feels like a perfect night  
For breakfast at midnight  
To fall in love with strangers  
Ah,ah,ah,ah  
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time  
Its miserable and magical, oh yeah  
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time  
  
I don't know about you  
But im feeling 22  
Everything will be alright if  
You keep me next to you  
You don't know about me  
But ill bet you want to  
Everything will be alright if  
We just keep dancing like we're... 22, 22  
  
It seems like one of those nights  
This place is too crowded  
Too many cool kids  
ah,ah,ah,ah  
It seems like one of those nights  
We ditch the whole scene  
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah...  
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way  
Its miserable and magical, oh yeah  
Tonights the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time  
  
I don't know about you  
But im feeling 22  
Everything will be alright if  
You keep me next to you  
You don't know about me  
But ill bet you want to  
Everything will be alright if  
We just keep dancing like we're... 22, 22  
  
I dont know about you  
22, 22  
  
It feels like one of those nights  
We ditch the whole scene  
It feels like one of those nights  
We won't be sleeping  
It feels like one of those nights  
You look like bad news  
I gotta have you  
I gotta have you  
  
I don't know about you  
But im feeling 22  
Everything will be alright if  
You keep me next to you  
You don't know about me  
But ill bet you want to  
Everything will be alright if  
We just keep dancing like we're... 22, 22  
  
22, 22  
  
It feels like one of those nights  
We ditch the whole scene  
It feels like one of those nights  
We won't be sleeping  
It feels like one of those nights  
You look like bad news  
I gotta have you  
I gotta have you

title: Fall Into Me

You say you've turned it off  
Hid your heart up on a shelf  
Scared of what it might cost  
To take it off for someone else  
'Cause lovin him you lost  
Too much of yourself  
Baby can't you see that he's not me and...  
  
I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open  
And will always be  
Right here waiting, staying strong  
Come and fall into me  
  
I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you  
I'll open up my soul  
If that's what you need me to do  
But now baby it's your move  
All you've got to do  
  
Is believe in love, just believe in us now...  
  
I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open  
And will always be  
Right here waiting, staying strong  
Come and fall into me  
  
Just believe in love  
Just believe in us  
Baby...  
  
I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open  
And will always be  
Right here waiting, staying strong  
Come and fall into me  
  
Come and fall into me  
Baby fall into me

title: Fall Back On You

Isn't it funny how many times we can say,  
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,  
And moved on  
That's what we thought  
  
But here I am in the same old car,  
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar  
Uh oh, uh oh,  
  
I won't tell nobody  
I won't tell my friends  
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends  
And we'll tell each other things like I need you  
  
You and me  
Baby this is what we do  
I may see  
There are people you just come back to  
So fall back on me  
Fall back on you  
  
You always let someone come in between  
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean  
Look at all this wasted time  
  
I won't tell nobody  
I won't tell my friend  
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end  
And we'll tell each other things, like I love you  
  
You and me  
Baby this is what we do  
I may see  
There are people who you come back to  
So fall back on me,  
Fall back on you  
  
Maybe we'll last  
Maybe we won't  
Maybe we'll stop talking and *?* like girls  
But just, baby, get along with me  
  
You and me  
Baby this is what we do  
I may see  
There are people that you come back too  
Fall back on me  
Baby I'll fall back on you  
Fall back on me baby,  
Baby I'll fall back on you  
Fall back on you  
  
Fall back on you

Everybody's waiting  
Everybody's watching  
Even when you're sleeping  
Keep your ey-eyes open  
  
A tricky thing  
As yestersday we were just children  
Playing soldiers  
Just pretending  
Dreaming dreams with happy endings  
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords  
But now we've stepped into a cruel world  
Where everybody wants to keep score

The tricky thing,  
Is yesterday we were just children,  
Playing soldiers, just pretending,

So here you are,  
Two steps ahead, and staying on guard.  
Every lesson forms a new scar,  
They never thought you'd make it this far.  
  
But turn around (turn around),

title: Everything Has Changed

[Taylor Swift]  
All I knew this morning when I woke  
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before  
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago  
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile  
In the back of my mind making me feel like  
  
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now  
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now  
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now  
I just wanna know you know you know you  
  
'Cause all I know is we said "Hello"  
And your eyes look like coming home  
All I know is a simple name  
Everything has changed  
All I know is you held the door  
You'll be mine and I'll be yours  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
And all my walls stood tall painted blue  
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you  
[Taylor Swift]  
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies  
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,  
Taking flight, making me feel like  
  
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now  
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now  
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now  
I just wanna know you know you know you  
  
'Cause all I know is we said "Hello"  
And your eyes look like coming home  
All I know is a simple name  
Everything has changed  
All I know is you held the door  
You'll be mine and I'll be yours  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed  
  
Come back and tell me why  
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh  
And meet me there tonight  
And let me know that it's not all in my mind  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now  
I just wanna know you know you know you  
  
[Both]  
'Cause all I know is we said "Hello"  
And your eyes look like coming home  
All I know is a simple name  
Everything has changed  
All I know is you held the door  
You'll be mine and I'll be yours  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed  
  
All I know is we said "Hello"  
So dust off your highest hopes  
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed  
All I know is the new found grace  
All my days I know your face  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

title: Enchanted

There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles  
Same old tired, lonely place  
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy  
Vanished when I saw your face  
  
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you  
  
Your eyes whispered "have we met?" across the room your silhouette  
Starts to make it's way to me  
The playful conversation starts counter all your quick remarks  
Like passing notes in secrecy  
  
And it was enchanting to meet you  
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you  
  
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
The lingering question kept me up 2am, who do you love?  
I wonder till I'm wide awake  
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door  
I'd open up and you would say, hey  
  
It was enchanting to meet you  
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you  
  
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
  
This night is flawless, don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
This is me praying that this was the very first page  
Not where the story line ends  
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again  
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon  
  
I was enchanted to meet you  
Please don't be in love with someone else  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you  
Please don't be in love with someone else  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you  
  
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
  
This night is flawless, don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
Please don't be in love with someone else  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

Turn your dial to 93. 7  
Broadway acts like he's 11  
Self-proclaimed, self  
Worse mistake ever to land in Michigan  
I'm just a singer of country songs  
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong  
But if you listen to just one thing I say  
  
You should turn 93 on  
Broadway's Electric Barnyard  
I sing a song called Tim Mcgraw  
Request it and they'll play it all day long  
I sing in stations all day long  
But there's nothin like when you're on  
The Electric Barnyard  
  
From a trailer park in St. Louis  
Growin' up not wearin' any shoes  
Prettiest hillbilly girl you see all day  
Growin' up the other trailer park girls  
Couldn't hide their jealousy  
Cuz she had the only phone for miles  
Now she uses it as a dj  
  
So you should turn? 93 on  
Broadway's Electric Barnyard  
I sing a song called Tim Mcgraw  
Request it and they'll play it all day long  
I sing in stations all day long  
But there's nothin like when you're on

title: Drops Of Jupiter

Now that he's back in the atmosphere  
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey  
Acts like summer and walks like rain  
Reminds me that there's time a to change, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey  
But since his return from his stay on the moon  
He listens like spring and she talks like June, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey  
  
But tell me did you sail across the sun  
Did you make it to the milky way  
To see the lights all faded  
And that heaven is overrated  
  
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star  
One without a permanent scar  
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there  
  
Now that he's back from that soul vacation  
Tracing his way through the constellation, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey  
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo  
Reminds me that there's room to grow, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey  
Now that he's back in the atmosphere  
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol Jane  
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land  
  
Tell me did this wind sweep you off your feet  
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day  
And head back to the milky way  
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind  
Was it everything you wanted to find  
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there  
  
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken  
Your best friend always sticking up for you  
Even when I know you're wrong  
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone  
Conversation  
The best soy latte that you ever had and me  
  
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet  
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day  
And head back to the milky way  
  
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star  
One without a permanent scar  
And did you miss my while you were looking for yourself out  
  
Na na na na na na na na na na na aaahh ooohhhooo  
Na na na na na na na na na na na aaahh...  
  
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken  
Your best friend always sticking up for you  
Even when I know you're wrong  
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone

title: Don't Tell Me You Want To, When I Don't Want To Aymore

You say you want to wait to get married,  
Why you in a pause,  
You say it's not your time yet,  
When is the perfect time for you  
  
Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you  
Tell me you found someone else in your life  
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you  
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore  
  
What changed your mind in two days  
Did I do something wrong to make you put a hold  
On our future,  
It was just a week ago when you asked me  
What date I plan to ask you the big question,  
Why did you do this to me  
  
Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you  
Tell me you found someone else in your life  
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you  
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore  
  
It was perfectly set how it would go down  
All our dream would have come real  
Now you put them in a coffin and put the dirt on them  
Should just add a stone to them and make it read  
Here lies the dreams of a fallen futures,  
  
Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you tell me you found someone  
Else in your life  
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you  
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore  
  
Why did yo do this  
Now I stand here with this ring, flowers, and dirt on my knees  
Tears falling down my eyes with humiliation,  
It might as well just rain and have lightning strike and miss me,  
Tonight isn't a luck y night,  
  
Now I can't look you in the eyes any more,  
Just go ahead and walk away  
Just leave me here in my misery of shame,  
  
Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you  
Tell me you found someone else in your life  
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you  
Don't say you're sorry  
And don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore  
  
You say you want to wait to get married  
You say you're not ready yet  
You say today isn't good enough for you  
Do me a favor and do put me on hold,  
Because I don't want to anymore

title: Disappointed Of You

I've waited all along,  
Thought that you'd stay,  
But you didn't really care,  
You just walk away,  
And I saw myself in the mirror,  
It's so hard to recognize,  
Everything you ever wanted was right here,  
But you never realized,  
  
And I'm really disappointed,  
So disappointed of you,  
I'm really disappointed of you,  
And I'm too frustrated of you,  
Disappointed of you,  
Baby, I'm disappointed of you,  
  
The roses I left you last night,  
And the calls unanswered,  
Sometimes I think we're getting nowhere,  
But you don't care 'cause you're a bastard,  
I can do nothing but think of you time and again,  
I can't watch you go leaving me alone,  
The more I try, the more gets the pain,  
Baby, this love is undone,  
  
And I'm really disappointed,  
So disappointed of you,  
I'm really disappointed of you,  
And I'm too frustrated of you,  
Disappointed of you,  
Baby, I'm disappointed of you,  
  
So you tell me where to go,  
Tell me something I already don't know,  
So hold my hands in yours like never before,  
Tell me that I won't be lonely anymore,  
  
And I'm really disappointed,  
So disappointed of you,  
I'm really disappointed of you,  
And I'm too frustrated of you,  
Disappointed of you,

title: Didn't They

She walks to school  
With her arms crossed  
It's just another day  
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming  
Then finally she sees them  
It's scary how things change  
And I saw the story on the news  
I saw the footage from the roof  
I sat down and cried  
  
Didn't she call you  
Didn't she need you bad enough  
Was there some reason  
I'm not aware of  
Did you not write it down  
Just one more thing to do  
Where were you  
And didn't she pray too  
  
He kissed his wife good bye  
And took the earliest flight  
So he could be home that night  
To put his kids to sleep  
Down the aisle  
Three men walked and said  
We're here to die for our God  
He stood up and said that's funny  
Cause my God died for me  
I put the magazine down  
I read his words out loud  
I sat down and cried  
  
Didn't he call you  
Didn't he need you bad enough  
Was there some reason  
I'm not aware of  
Did you not write it down  
Just one more thing to do  
Where were you  
And didn't he pray too  
  
The taxis were full up  
On the very day of  
They rode 100 floors up  
Just to come back down  
They never thought they'd see the day  
That the tower's up in flames  
There was nothing left to say  
When it all came down  
  
And didn't they call you  
Didn't they need you bad enough  
Was there some reason  
I'm not aware of  
Did you not write it down  
Just one more thing to do  
Where were you  
Where were you  
And didn't they pray too oh  
  
I walk to school  
And I wear a cross  
I'm counting  
Every day

title: Dear John

Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you  
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through  
Again  
And my mother accused me of losing my mind  
But I swore I was fine  
You paint me a blue sky  
And go back and turn it to rain  
And I lived in your chess game but you changed the rules everyday  
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone  
Tonight  
Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home  
I should've known  
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame  
Maybe it's you and you're sick need to give love and take it away  
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand  
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said run as fast as you
can  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home  
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong  
Don't you think 19's too young to be played by your dark twisted games  
When I loved you so  
I should have known  
You are an expert at "sorry"  
And keeping lines blurry  
Never impressed by me acing your tests  
All the girls that you've run dry have tired, lifeless eyes  
Cause you burned them out  
But I took your matches before fire could catch me  
So don't look now  
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town...  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home  
I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress wrote you a song  
You should've known  
You should've known  
Don't you think I was too young?  
You should've known...

This melody is what your love means to me  
I love you so much babe can't you see  
It is like a rainbow after the thunderstorm  
Your love aways kept me safe and warm,  
  
You had to walk through that open door  
I suddenly fell down to the floor  
It hurt so much to live without you  
I tried not to think about you  
  
You were more than I ever had  
My love for you still makes me glad  
So please come back we could start anew  
No more sitting around feeling blue  
  
So come on, it wil be just me and you  
Don't hesitate  
It would be great  
It's not too late  
Lets celebrate!

title: You're Not Sorry

All this time I was wasting,  
Hoping you would come around  
I've been givin' out chances every time  
And all you do is let me down  
And it's taken me this long baby  
But I figured you out  
And you think it would be fine again  
But not this time around  
  
You don't have to call anymore  
I won't pick up the phone  
This is the last straw  
Don't wanna hurt anymore  
And you can tell me that you're sorry  
But I don't believe you baby,  
Like I did before  
You're not sorry.  
Oh no, no, no.  
  
Looking so innocent,  
I might believe you if I didn't know  
Could've loved you all my life  
If you hadn't left me waitin' in the cold  
And you got to share your secrets  
And I'm tired of being last to know  
And now you're asking me to listen  
Cause it's worked each time before  
  
But you don't have to call anymore  
I won't pick up the phone  
This is the last straw  
Don't wanna hurt anymore  
And you can tell me that you're sorry  
But I don't believe you baby,  
Like I did before  
You're not sorry.  
No, no, Oh.  
You're not sorry.  
No, no, Oh.  
  
You had me crawling for you honey  
And it never would have gone away, no  
You used to shine so bright,  
But I watched all of it fade  
  
So you don't have to call anymore  
I won't pick up the phone  
This is the last straw  
There's nothing left to beg for  
And you can tell me that you're sorry  
But I don't believe you baby,  
Like I did before  
You're not sorry.  
No, no, Oh.  
You're not sorry.  
No, no. Oh.

title: Your Guardian Angel

When I see your smile  
Tears run down my face I can't replace  
And now that I'm stronger I've figured out  
How this world turns cold and breaks through my soul  
And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one  
  
I will never let you fall  
I'll stand up with you forever  
I'll be there for you through it all  
Even if saving you sends me to heaven  
  
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.  
Seasons are changing  
And waves are crashing  
And stars are falling all for us  
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter  
I can show you I can be the one  
  
I will never let you fall  
I'll stand up with you forever  
I'll be there for you through it all  
Even if saving you sends me to heaven  
  
Cuz you're my, you're my, my true love, my whole heart  
Please don't throw that away  
Cause I'm here for you  
Please don't walk away,  
Please tell me you'll stay, stay  
  
Use me as you will  
Pull my strings just for a thrill  
And I know I'll be ok  
Though my skies are turning grey  
  
I will never let you fall  
I'll stand up with you forever  
I'll be there for you through it all  
Even if saving you sends me to heaven  
  
I will never let you fall  
I'll stand up with you forever  
I'll be there for you through it all  
Even if saving you sends me to heaven  
  
I will never let you fall  
I'll stand up with you forever

title: Your Face

I heard a song  
Tonight on the radio  
Another girl sings about a boy  
She sees his face  
In every space, every room  
And I know  
That if I turn around  
You won't be there  
If I close my eyes  
Will you be there?  
  
Chorus:  
I don't wanna lose your face  
I don't wanna wake up one day  
And not remember what time erased  
I don't wanna turn around  
Cause I'm not scared  
Of what love gave me and took away  
And I don't wanna lose your face  
  
I've got a picture of you  
In my bedroom  
I hope it never falls  
I hope I never lose that feeling  
I used to get when you called  
And now I wonder to myself  
Who were you, where are you?  
Were you ever here at all?  
  
Chorus:  
I don't wanna lose your face  
I don't wanna wake up one day  
And not remember what time erased  
I don't wanna turn around  
Cause I'm not scared  
Of what love gave me and took away  
And I don't wanna lose your face  
  
That girl in the song  
Had it so good  
I wish I could close my eyes  
And see you  
I wish the sky had your face  
And the oceans had your eyes  
And the sunset had your lips  
And I had you  
  
Chorus:  
I don't wanna lose your face  
I don't wanna wake up one day  
And not remember what time erased  
And I don't wanna turn around  
Cause I'm not scared  
Of what love gave me and took away  
And I don't wanna lose your face  
Oh, no, no  
I don't wanna lose your face  
I don't wanna turn around  
Oh, oh, oh yeah  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh yeah

title: Your Anything

I betchya lie awake at night  
Tryin to make up your sweet mind  
Wonderin if you'll ever find  
Just what you want  
A home-town number one  
Or a california loaded gun  
But you know you only get one  
Or that's what you thought  
But here's what you've got  
  
I could be your favorite blue jeans  
With the holes in the knees  
In the bottom of the top drawer  
I could be your little beauty queen  
Just a little outta reach  
Or the girl livin next door  
I'll be your angel givin up her wings  
If that's whatchya need  
I'd give everything to be your anything  
  
If you want hard to get  
If you want...  
All you have to do is let me know  
If you want a bumpy ride  
Or someone with a softer side  
Either one'll be alright  
Just let me know  
Cause this is where it goes  
  
I could be your favorite blue jeans  
With the holes in the knees  
In the bottom of the top drawer  
I could be your little beauty queen  
Just a little outta reach  
Or the girl livin next door  
I'll be your angel givin up her wings  
If that's whatchya need  
I'd give everything to be your anything  
  
It's not like I'm givin up who I am for you  
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do  
  
I could be your favorite blue jeans  
With the holes in the knees  
In the bottom of the top drawer  
I could be your little beauty queen  
Just a little outta reach  
Or the girl livin next door

title: You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home

You wake up, it's raining and it's Monday  
Looks like one of those rough days  
Time's up, you're late again, so get out the door  
Sometimes you feel like running  
Find a whole new life and jump in  
Let go, get up and hit the dance floor  
But when the lights go down it's the ending of the show  
And you're feeling like you've got nowhere to go  
Don't you know?  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye and you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
You can change your style, you can change your jeans  
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams  
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows  
You'll always find your way back home  
  
Your best friends, your little hometown  
Are waiting up wherever you go now  
You know that you can always turn around  
Cause this world is big and it's crazy  
And this girl is thinking that maybe  
This life is what some people dream about  
Cause when I'm feeling down and I'm all alone  
I've always got a place where I can go  
Cause I know  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes You can change your
mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye and you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
You can change your style, you can change your jeans  
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams  
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows  
You'll always find your way back home  
  
Where they know exactly who you are  
Where the real you is the superstar  
You know it's never too far away  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye and you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye, you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
You can change your style, you can change your jeans  
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams  
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows  
You'll always find your way back home  
You'll always find your way back home

title: You R In Love

[Verse:]  
One look, dark room meant just for you  
Time moved too fast, you play it back  
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke  
No proof not much  
But you saw enough  
Small talk, he drives  
Coffee at midnight  
The light reflects the chain on your neck  
He says "Look up" and your shoulders brush  
No proof one touch and you felt enough  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can hear it in the silence, silence you  
You can feel it on the way home, way home you  
You can see it with the lights out, lights out  
You're in love  
True love  
You are in love  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday  
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word  
And for once you let go of your fears and your ghosts  
One step, not much but it said enough  
You kiss on side walks, you fight, and you talk  
One night he wakes, strange look on his face  
Pauses, then says "You're my best friend."  
And you knew what it was, he is in love  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can hear it in the silence, silence you  
You can feel it on the way home, way home you  
You can see it with the lights out, lights out  
You're in love  
True love  
  
And so it goes you two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round  
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown  
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars  
And why I spent my whole life trying to put it into words  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can hear it in the silence  
You can feel it on the way home  
You can see it with the lights out  
You're in love  
True love  
You are in love  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can hear it in the silence, silence you  
You feel it on the way home, way home you  
You can see it with the lights out, lights out  
You're in love  
True love  
You are in love (x2)  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can hear it in the silence, silence you  
You feel it on the way home, way home you  
You can see it with the lights out, lights out  
You're in love  
True love  
You are in love

title: You Got It All... Wrong

You wanna dance you really wanna let it go  
You want it bad but this time they told you to go  
You want it  
  
You try it fast when you really should do it slow  
You got it bad and it's time I told you no  
You're on it  
  
Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know  
What you had or you did  
So just let it go  
  
Oh no!  
  
You wanna laugh and you really wanna let them know  
You're so relaxed and you really gonna let it show  
You want it  
  
Do you recall when we were two of a kind  
But you chose your way, and I chose mine  
You're on it  
  
Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know  
What you had or you did  
So just let it go  
  
Oh no!  
Remote controlled but you got it all  
Oh no!  
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all  
Oh no!  
Remote controlled but you got it all and you got it all  
But you got it all wrong!  
  
We had a laugh, but it turned into a cough  
We got along but now I wanna get off  
You're on it  
  
I was a kid when I did what you do  
I put a lid on and thought that's it, I'm through  
You're on it  
  
Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know  
What you had or you did  
So just let it go  
  
Oh no!  
Remote controlled but you got it all  
Oh no!  
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all  
Oh no!  
Remote controlled but you got it all  
Oh no!  
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all  
  
Oh no!  
  
And when I say you lose it, you don't believe it at all  
Oh no!  
It's such a long way to fall, the writings on the wall  
Oh no!  
But when I said you'd lose it, I can't even recall  
Oh no!  
If it was the best of all your brain a bit too small  
Because you got it all, you got it all, you got it all  
But you got it all wrong!

Here I am, once again  
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving  
I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing  
Here I am, once again  
In your driveway thinking I should be leaving  
I should go but it's so  
Entertaining watching you breathing  
You went and got to me like  
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget  
But it sticks in your head  
So goodbye, it's not goodnight  
Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'  
  
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart  
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car  
Caught a red light I ran right through  
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you  
Always looking like a one of those nights  
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light  
You got me, you do  
  
In a daze, pull the shades  
Close my eyes and picture you at my window  
I relax; I go back to all the things you said  
That only I know  
  
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart  
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car  
Caught a red light I ran right through  
Gotta call my all my friends, tell them all about you  
Always looking like a one of those nights  
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light  
You got me, you do  
  
I run right out to my car  
And I pull out the drive  
It's only been ten minutes  
But I have to see you one more time  
  
Cause you got me like a shot to the heart  
Got me shakin' so bad, I spilled my coffee in the car  
Caught a red light I ran right through  
Gotta call my all my friends, tell them all about you  
And it's looking like a one of those nights  
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light  
You got me, you do  
Oh, you got me, you do

title: You Belong With Me

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset  
She's going off about something that you said  
She doesn't get your humour like I do  
  
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night  
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like  
And she'll never know your story like I do  
  
But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts  
She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you'll wake up and find  
That what you're lookin for has been here the whole time  
  
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see?  
You belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Walkin the streets with you and your all worn out jeans,  
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be  
Laughing on the park bench thinkin to myself  
Hey isn't this easy?  
  
And you've got that smile that could light up this whole town  
I haven't seen it in awhile, since she brought you down  
You say you fine I know you better than that  
Hey, Whatcha doing with a girl like that?  
  
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers  
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you'll wake up and find  
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time  
  
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see?  
You belong with me  
  
Standin by, I'm waiting at your back door  
All this time how could you not know baby?  
You belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Oh I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night  
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're about to cry  
I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams  
I think I know where you belong. I think I know it's with me.  
  
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?  
Been here all along so why can't you see?  
You belong with me  
  
Standing by, I'm waiting at your back door  
All this time how could you not know baby  
You belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
You belong with me  
Have you ever thought just maybe  
You belong with me

title: Writing Songs About You

I can't believe you did it again  
Walked by and took my heart with you  
Why did you have to look so good?  
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you  
Trying to have a dream without you in it  
But how can I put out this fire  
When you're the one who lit it  
  
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending  
That I'm really ok when I'm not  
I want to know how it feels to be  
Over you for real  
Until I do  
I'll keep writing songs about you  
  
I've got a stack of papers so high  
And it's all about you baby  
Keep thinking maybe I  
Can make sense of something crazy  
Something I can't get out of my Head  
I write your name I write your name  
Then I tear it all to shreds  
  
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending  
That I'm really ok when I'm not  
I want to know how it feels to be  
Over you for real  
Until I do  
I'll keep writing songs about you  
  
And if you ever change your mind  
And want me back again  
I hope these songs will remind me  
Why I shouldn't let you in  
  
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending  
That I'm really ok cause I'm not  
I want to know how it feels to be  
Over you for real  
Until I do  
  
I'll just wait for the day  
I stop pretending  
That I'm really ok when I'm not  
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real  
Till I do,  
I'll keep writing songs about you

Verse 1  
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain  
We jumped, never asking why  
We kissed, I fell under your spell  
A love no one could deny  
[Pre-Hook:]  
Dont you ever say I just walked away  
I will always want you  
I cant live a lie, running for my life  
I will always want you  
[Hook 1:]  
I came in like a wrecking ball  
I never hit so hard in love  
All I wanted was to break your walls  
All you ever did was break me  
Yeah, you wreck me  
[Verse 2:]  
I put you high up in the sky  
And now, youre not coming down  
It slowly turned, you let me burn  
And now, were ashes on the ground  
[Pre-Hook & Hook 1]  
[Hook 2:]  
I came in like a wrecking ball  
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung  
Left me crashing in a blazing fall  
All you ever did was break me  
Yeah, you wreck me  
[Bridge:]  
I never meant to start a war  
I just wanted you to let me in  
And instead of using force  
I guess I shouldve let you in  
I never meant to start a war  
I just wanted you to let me in  
I guess I shouldve let you in

Dont you ever say I just walked away

[Verse:]  
Flashing lights and we  
Took a wrong turn and we  
Fell down a rabbit hole  
You held on tight to me  
Cause nothing's as it seems and spinning out of control  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things  
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me  
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?  
Didn't it all seem new and exciting  
I felt your arms twistin' round me  
I should have slept with one eye open at night  
  
[Chorus:]  
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it  
And we pretended it could last forever  
We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it  
And life was never worse but never better  
In Wonderland  
In Wonderland  
In Wonderland  
  
[Verse 2:]  
So we went on our way, too in love to think straight  
All alone or so it seemed  
But there was strangers watching  
And whispers turned to talking  
And talking turned to screams, oh  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things  
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me  
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile  
Didn't it all feel new and exciting  
I felt your arms twisting round me  
Its all fun and games till somebody looses their mind  
  
[Chorus:]  
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it  
And we pretended it could last forever  
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it  
And life was never worse but never better  
In Wonderland  
In Wonderland  
In Wonderland  
  
I reached for you but you were gone  
I knew I had to go back home  
You searched the world for something else  
To make you feel like what we had  
And in the end, in Wonderland  
We both went mad  
  
[Chorus:]  
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it  
And we pretended it could last forever  
We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it  
And life was never worse but never better  
In Wonderland  
In Wonderland

title: Wildest Dreams

[Verse 1]  
He said, "Let's get out of this town  
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"  
I thought, heaven can't help me now  
Nothing lasts forever  
But this is gonna take me down  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
He's so tall and handsome as hell  
He's so bad, but he does it so well  
I can see the end as it begins  
My one condition is  
  
[Chorus]  
Say you'll remember me  
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again  
Even if it's just in your  
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha  
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha  
  
[Verse 2]  
I said, "No one has to know what we do"  
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room  
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever  
But this is getting good now  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
He's so tall and handsome as hell  
He's so bad, but he does it so well  
And when we've had our very last kiss  
My last request is  
  
[Chorus]  
Say you'll remember me  
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again  
Even if it's just in your  
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha  
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha  
  
[Bridge]  
You see me in hindsight  
Tangled up with you all night  
Burning it down  
Someday when you leave me  
I bet these memories  
Follow you around  
  
You see me in hindsight  
Tangled up with you all night  
Burning it down  
Someday when you leave me  
I bet these memories  
Follow you around  
  
[Chorus - Variation]  
Say you'll remember me  
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again  
Even if it's just in pretend

Say you'll remember me  
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe

title: Who I've Always Been

You walk in here with your guitar man  
Your shiney boots and full on band  
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand  
Singing songs you got memorised  
With whatever talent money buys  
So polished that it slips right through your hands  
Don't worry yourself, I ain't your competition  
But don't flatter yourself, that was never my intention  
  
I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't  
Let's talk about what you do that I can't  
Let's talk about you and me in an empty room and who wins  
Let's talk about what you did to get here  
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears  
Let's talk about what you wanna be  
And who I've always been, yeah  
  
I walk in here with my beat up case  
The same guitar I've always played  
And the words I wrote down on a page  
When I was twelve years old and small town raised  
You tell the crowd you pay in dues  
I tell them this is what I do  
And it's what I put my life into  
As I breathe in smoke and cheap perfume  
And say life on musical road is rough conditions  
Oh, but the easy ride was never my ambition  
  
I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't  
Let's talk about what you do that I can't  
Let's talk about you and me in an empty room and who wins  
Let's talk about what you did to get here  
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears  
Let's talk about what you wanna be  
And who I've always been, yeah  
  
Let's talk about your childhood days  
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage  
So where's that crown gotten you these days?  
When it's me and you and the same damn games  
  
Let's talk about what you got that I ain't  
Let's talk about what you do that I can't  
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins  
I wanna talk about what you did to get here  
Let's talk aboyt blood and sweat and tears  
Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl  
And who I've always been

title: White Horse

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel  
Comes out just when you need it to  
As I paced back and forth all this time  
Cause I honestly believed in you  
  
Holding on, the days drag on  
Stupid girl, I should have known  
I should have known  
  
I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale  
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet  
Lead her up the stairwell  
  
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town  
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down  
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around  
  
Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes  
And never really had a chance  
(My mistake, I didn't know to be in love  
You had to fight to have the upper hand)  
I had so many dreams about you and me  
Happy endings, now I know  
  
I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale  
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet  
Lead her up the stairwell  
  
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town  
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down  
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around  
  
And there you are on your knees  
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me  
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry  
  
Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale  
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well  
This is a big world, that was a small town  
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now  
  
And it's too late for you and your white horse  
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now  
  
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Try and catch me now  
Oh, it's too late to catch me now

title: White Christmas

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
So may your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white

title: White Blank Page

Can you lie next to her  
Give her your heart, your heart  
As well as your body  
And can you lie next to her  
And confess your love, your love  
As well as your folly  
And can you kneel before the king  
And say I'm clean, I'm clean  
  
So tell me now where was my fault  
In loving you with my whole heart  
Tell me now where was my fault  
In loving you with my whole heart  
  
A white blank page  
And a swelling rage, rage  
You did not think  
Oh you sent me to the brink the brink  
  
You desired my attention  
But denied my affection, my affection  
  
Tell me now where was my fault  
In loving you with my whole heart  
Tell me now where was my fault  
In loving you with my whole heart  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh(4x)  
  
Lead me to the truth and I  
Will follow you with my whole life  
Lead me to the truth and I  
Will follow you with my whole life

title: What To Wear

She's looking in the mirror  
The moments getting nearer  
She thinks about it as she walks her walk  
Up and down the staircase  
Makeup fresh on her face  
She thinks about it as she talks her talk  
School dance, first chance, always been a dreamer  
There's one guy, she's shy, sees him through the mirror  
And everybody looks at her,  
She thinks about it  
  
Blue dress angel face, looking in the mirror,  
Shoes, purse, hair tied back and you should see her,  
She's got her magic, floating through the air,  
  
Peace, Love, One thing leads into another  
Dream big, Aim small  
Man you gotta love her  
She's got her hopes up  
Got 'em up to there  
Wonderin' what to wear  
  
She's standing in her bedroom  
He'll be pullin' up soon  
She thinks about it as she sees headlights  
Looking out the window she's got her diary to show  
That she's been waiting for this all her life  
First date, can't wait  
Lookin' in the mirror  
Heart all wrapped up  
Wait until he sees her  
He's lookin' right at her  
She thinks about it  
  
Sixteen blue jeans Abercrombie t-shirt  
Shoes purse hair tied back and you should see her  
She's got her magic floating through the air  
  
Peace, Love, One thing leads into another  
Dream big, Aim small  
Man you gotta love her  
She's got her hopes up  
Got 'em up to there  
Wonderin' what to wear  
  
The years went by  
The mirror saw her cry  
She got up again  
She got up again  
The wind blew by the small town lights  
She got up again  
  
Move out  
Find out where the world can take her  
Bright lights late nights livin' for the greater  
Move to Paris livin' on a prayer  
  
Peace, Love, One thing leads into another  
Dream big, Aim small  
Man you gotta love her  
She's got her hopes up  
Got 'em up to there  
She's got her hopes up  
Got 'em up to there  
Wonderin' what to wear  
Ooo Ooo

What do you say, when you just know  
That he's the one, and you wanna go fast  
But he's taking it slow  
And what do you do, when he's next to you  
But he's a little bit shy  
Well here's something you can try  
  
Hey, hey what do you say  
We go walking down the river all together  
It's a warm May beautiful day  
And I feel like I could  
Talk to you forever  
With the sun shining bright  
It feels just like a day  
When everything's gonna go just right  
I know it will be a sweet memory  
For you and me someday  
What do you say?  
  
What do you see, when you look in his eyes  
There's something there  
That he can't disguise  
No matter how he tries  
And what do you feel, when you know it's real  
And you can't sit still  
If you don't own up will yeah

title: Welcome To New York

[Verse:]  
Walking through a crowd, the village's aglow  
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats  
Everybody here wanted something more  
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before  
And it said  
  
[Chorus:]  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
It's a new soundtrack  
I can dance to this beat (beat)  
Forevermore  
The lights are so bright  
But they never blind me (me)  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors  
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer  
Everybody here was someone else before  
And you can want who you want  
Boys and boys and girls and girls  
  
[Chorus:]  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
It's a new soundtrack  
I can dance to this beat (beat)  
Forevermore  
The lights are so bright  
But they never blind me (me)  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
  
[Bridge:]  
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing  
Like any real love, it's ever-changing  
Like any true love, it drives you crazy  
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything  
  
[Chorus:]  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
It's a new soundtrack  
I can dance to this beat (beat)

They dropped him off  
In the amazon

Ate some piranhas

But whatever  
Makes you happy

title: We Were Happy

We used to walk along the street  
When the porch lights were shining bright  
Before I had somewhere to be  
Back when we had all night  
And we were happy  
  
I do recall a good while back  
We snuck into the circus  
You threw your arms around my neck  
Back when I deserved it  
And we were happy  
  
When it was good baby,  
It was good baby  
We showed 'um all up  
No one could touch the way we  
Laughed in the dark  
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm  
We were gonna buy someday  
And we were happy  
  
We used to watch the sun go down  
On the boats in the water  
That's sorta how I feel right now  
And Goodbye's so much harder  
'Cause we were happy  
  
When it was good baby,  
It was good baby  
We showed 'um all up  
No one could touch the way we  
Laughed in the dark  
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm  
We were gonna buy someday  
And we were happy  
  
Oh, I hate those voices  
Telling me I'm not in love anymore  
But they don't give me choices  
And that's what these tears are for  
'Cause we were happy  
  
We Were Happy  
  
When it was good baby,  
It was good baby  
We showed 'um all up  
No one could touch the way we  
Laughed in the dark  
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm  
And you were gonna marry me  
When we were happy  
  
Yeah, We were were happy  
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

title: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together

I remember when we broke up, the first time  
Saying this is it, I've had enough, 'cause like  
We haven't seen each other in a month  
When you, said you, needed space, what?  
Then you come around again and say  
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change  
Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day  
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you  
  
Oooh we called it off again last night  
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
You go talk to your friends talk  
To my friends talk to me  
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together  
  
Like ever...  
  
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights  
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right  
And you, will hide away and find your piece of mind, with some indie record  
That's much cooler than mine  
  
Oooh you called me up again tonight  
But oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
You go talk to your friends talk  
To my friends talk to me  
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together  
  
I used to think, that we, were forever ever  
And I used to say never say never  
  
(Talks)  
  
Huh, he calls me up and he's like, I still love you  
And I'm like, I'm just, I mean this is exhausting, you know like  
We are never getting back together, like ever  
  
No!  
  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
You go talk to your friends talk  
To my friends talk to me  
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Oh, getting back together

title: Wait For Me

If you had only gotten to me first  
If I could write a book on how this hurts  
If you could see the way your smile looks to me  
  
If I wasnt scared of the world alone  
If I didnt know he loves me so  
If I could only find the strength to leave  
Youd be with me, so baby  
  
Dont you look in my eyes  
I might fall in love  
With a beautiful boy  
I wish that I could touch  
You go I hope you think of me  
  
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade  
This girl is begging wait for me  
  
Its so wrong that all I wanna do  
Is forget it all and just be with you  
I have to go cause he dont know  
But the writings on the wall  
  
But here we are in so deep  
Soaking wet  
Jumping in without no safety net  
And I dont know what kinda ropes  
Would break this kinda fall, so baby  
  
Dont you look in my eyes  
I might fall in love  
With a beautiful boy  
I wish that I could touch  
You go, I hope you think of me  
  
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade  
This girl is begging wait, wait for me  
  
We cant be together right now  
Guess theres no use in trying  
But if you look at me right now  
Can you tell that Im dying  
To hold you  
But it would be wrong to  
  
So dont you look in my eyes  
I might fall in love  
With a beautiful boy  
I wish that I could touch  
You go I hope you think of me  
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade  
This girl is begging wait for me  
  
Dont you look now  
Dont you look now

title: Viva La Vida

I used to rule the world  
Seas would rise when I gave the word  
Now in the morning I sleep alone  
Sweep the streets I used to own  
  
I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"  
  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never  
Never an honest word  
And that was when I ruled the world  
  
It was the wicked and wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be king?  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know Saint Peter won't call my name  
Never an honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know Saint Peter won't call my name  
Never an honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world

The mistakes I'm making have gone from not so bad to awful  
I'm walking in circles doing everything I did wrong again  
And I know that at one point it was everything I wanted  
But now that it's over it's everything I wish I never did  
  
And now I'm looking in the mirror and seeing someone I don't want to see  
And I just wanna go back to how things used to be  
When I was still innocent  
Still sweet  
When I was still untouched  
  
You won't talk to me anymore you won't even answer my texts  
I don't know how things got this bad within a blink of an eye  
But I know that it did and I can't fix it this time  
  
And now I'm looking in the mirror and seeing someone I don't want to see  
And I just wanna go back to how things used to be  
When I was still innocent  
Still sweet  
When I was still untouched  
When I was untouched  
  
When I was that little girl who never did anything wrong  
The girl who was sweet and always got along with everyone  
I wanna go back to the old me who was free from all the trouble  
  
And now I'm looking in the mirror and seeing someone I don't want to see  
And I just wanna go back to how things used to be  
When I was still innocent  
Still sweet

And I just wanna go back to when we were friends  
When I was still innocent  
Still sweet

The look in your eyes, showed me no surprise

Going out for dinner every night  
Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies  
Going out to the football games

But you'll still be my star  
  
Baby cause in the dark  
You can't see shiny cars  
That's when you need me there  
With you I'll always share  
  
Because when the sun shine  
We'll shine together  
Told you I'll be here forever  
Said that I'll always be a friend  
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end  
  
Now it's raining more than ever  
Know that we'll still have each other  
  
You can stand under my umbrella  
You can stand under my umbrella  
Ella... Ella... Eh.. Yea.. Eh  
Under my umbrella  
Ella... Ella... Eh... Eh... Eh eh eh eh

title: Treacherous

Put your lips close to mine  
As long as they don't touch  
Out of focus, eye to eye  
Till the gravity's too much  
And I'll do anything you say  
If you say it with your hands  
And I'd be smart to walk away  
But you're quick sand  
  
This slope is Treacherous  
This path is reckless  
This slope is Treacherous  
And I I I like it  
  
I can't decide if it's a choice  
Getting swept away  
I hear the sound of my own voice  
Asking you to stay  
And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along  
Forever going with the flow but you're friction  
  
This slope is Treacherous  
This path is reckless  
This slope is Treacherous  
I I I like it  
  
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night  
And I will get you get you alone  
Your name has echoed through my mind  
And I just think you should think you should know  
That nothing safe is worth the drive  
And I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home  
  
This hope is Treacherous  
This day dream is dangerous  
This hope is Treacherous  
I I I, I I I, I I I  
  
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night  
And I will get you get you alone  
Your name has echoed through my mind  
And I just think you should think you should know  
That nothing safe is worth the drive  
And I will follow you follow you home  
I'll follow you follow you home  
I'll follow you follow you home  
I'll follow you follow you home  
This slope is Treacherous  
I I I like it

title: Tonight Is Our Last Night

Oh  
We were standing in an empty room  
The moonlight was fallin'  
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you  
And I coulda spent a life with you  
But those days are over  
You were callin my name  
When your face faded from view  
  
Wasn't it you that told me?  
The sun would always chase the day  
Wasn't it you that told me?  
  
Angels fly, in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?  
Stars collide in the air so light  
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night  
  
Oh  
I remember waking up with you  
The days doin' nothin'  
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew  
You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar  
Hope the the world never tore that out of you  
  
Wasn't it you that told me?  
The sun would always chase the day  
Wasn't it you that told me?  
  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?  
And stars collide in the air so light  
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?  
  
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?  
And the songs we played and the indian days  
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?  
Like harold and martin singing  
  
I was waving as you drove away  
The sunlight was falling  
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane  
  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Was it just like the promises that we made?  
And stars collide in the air so light  
Was it just like those promises that you made?  
On our last night  
On our last night  
Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, oh

title: Today Was A Fairytale

Today was a fairytale  
You were the prince  
I used to be a damsel in distress  
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Today was a fairytale  
I wore a dress  
You wore a dark grey t-shirt  
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess  
Today was a fairytale  
Time slows down whenever you're around  
  
But can you feel this magic in the air?  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Today was a fairytale  
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet  
Every move you make everything you say is right  
Today was a fairytale  
Today was a fairytale  
All that I can say is now it's getting so much clearer  
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Time slows down whenever you're around  
Yeah yeah  
  
But can you feel this magic in the air?  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Time slows down whenever you're around  
I can feel my heart  
It's beating in my chest  
Did you feel it?  
I can't put this down  
  
But can you feel this magic in the air?  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
But can you feel this magic in the air?  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Oh oh oh  
Yeah ohooh...

title: To Say

[Verse:]:  
You take all the words you said to her and put them up as a wall of gray,
protecting yourself from the world that you believe in, I didn't know you
would be able to say all the things you did so I take them and put them up as
a wall of gray, protecting myself from the world I believe in  
Chorus1:  
She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, while you ignored the
world and listend to the fray, and you said you wouldn't be embarassed if you
said that word again but we both go embarassed when we said her name  
[Verse 2:]:  
The words written on the wall didn't have anything against anybody, were not
in a war so what are we fighting for, I don't know so just shut-up and say all
the thing you've wanted to say, the page filled with words in gray and it's
about you  
Chorus2:  
I've never been anywhere cold as you, you give rainy endings to perfect days,
that's why I hate you for who you are  
Verse3:  
If you were the only thing I needed we wouldn't be this way, so she just said
everything, everybody wanted her to say, but I'm not gonna say it oh, no, no,
no  
Chorus3:  
She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, you promised me
everything I wanted but you gave it to everybody else instead, but you never
gave us a damn thing so we cry, cry alone or is it together I don't know

title: Tim McGraw

You said the way my blue eyes shined,  
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night  
I said "That's a lie"  
  
Just a boy in a Chevy truck,  
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,  
On back roads at night  
And I was right there beside him all summer long  
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone  
  
But when you think Tim Mcgraw,  
I hope you think my favorite song  
The one we danced to all night long  
The moon like a spotlight on the lake  
  
When you think happiness,  
I hope you think that little black dress  
Think of my head on your chest,  
And my old faded blue jeans  
  
When you think Tim Mcgraw,  
I hope you think of me  
  
September saw a month of tears,  
And thankin' God that you weren't here,  
To see me like that  
But in a box beneath my bed  
Is a letter that you never read  
From three summers back  
It's hard not to find it all a little  
Bitter sweet  
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe  
  
When you think Tim Mcgraw,  
I hope you think my favorite song  
The one we danced to all night long  
The moon like a spotlight on the lake  
  
When you think happiness,  
I hope you think that little black dress  
Think of my head on your chest,  
And my old faded blue jeans  
When you think Tim Mcgraw,  
I hope you think of me  
  
And I'm back for the first time since then  
I'm standin' on your street,  
And there's a letter left on your doorstep,  
And the first thing that you'll read  
  
Is when you think Tim Mcgraw  
I hope you think my favorite song  
Someday you'll turn your radio on,  
I hope it takes you back to that place  
When you think happiness,  
I hope you think that little black dress  
Think of my head on your chest  
And my old faded blue jeans  
When you think Tim Mcgraw  
I hope you think of me  
  
Oh, think of me,  
Hmm  
Hmm  
  
He said the way my blue eyes shined,  
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night  
I said "That's a lie"

title: Til Brad Pitt Comes Along

Do you remember the day  
I leaned up against your car  
And it started rolling down the street  
You screamed and ran after it  
And tried to open the door  
And it ran over your foot  
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.  
  
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you  
It takes five seconds to need you  
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds  
'Cause they don't know to play our song  
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you  
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me  
'Cause that's where you belong  
Until Brad Pitt comes along  
  
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie  
And you said it reminded you of me  
And I threw the remote at you  
And you said "my point exactly"  
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,  
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.  
  
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you  
It takes five seconds to need you When I'm mad at all the lovebirds  
'Cause they don't know to play our song  
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you  
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me  
'Cause that's where you belong  
Until Brad Pitt comes along  
  
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything  
But I swear I'd be careful with it  
If you gave me a ring  
  
And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you  
It takes five seconds to need you  
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds  
'Cause they don't play our song  
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you  
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me  
'Cause that's where you belong  
Until Brad Pitt comes along  
'Til Brad Pitt comes along  
Yeah, oh oh  
Until Brad Pitt comes along

title: Tied Together With A Smile

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty  
Is the face in the mirror  
Looking back at you  
  
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty  
But that's not true,  
Cause I know you...  
  
Hold on,  
Baby, you're losing it  
The water's high, you're jumping into it  
And letting go...  
And no one knows  
  
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone  
That you might not be the golden one  
And you're tied together with a smile  
But you're coming undone  
  
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted  
Cause you're  
Giving it away like it's extra change  
Hoping it will end up in his pocket  
  
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain  
Oh, cause it's not his price to pay  
  
Its Not his price to pay...  
  
Hold on,  
Baby, you're losing it  
The water's high, you're jumping into it  
And letting go...  
And no one knows  
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone  
That you might not be the golden one  
  
And you're tied together with a smile  
But you're coming undone  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
Hold on,  
Baby, you're losing it  
The water's high, you're jumping into it  
And letting go...  
And no one knows  
  
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone  
That you might not be the golden one  
  
You're tied together with a smile  
But you're coming undone...  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
You're tied together with a smile  
But you're coming undone...  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Goodbye, baby  
With a smile, baby, baby

title: This Love

[Verse:]  
Clear blue water, high tides came and brought you in  
And I could go on and on, on and on  
And I will  
Skies grew darker, currents put you out again  
And you are just gone and gone, gone and gone  
In silent screams and wildest dreams  
I never dreamed of this  
  
[Chorus:]  
This love is good, this love is bad  
This love is alive back from the dead...oh oh oh  
These hands had to let it go free  
And this love came back to me...oh oh oh... oh oh oh... oh oh oh  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Tossing, turning, struggle through the night with someone new  
And I could go on and on, on and on  
Lantern, burning, flickered in my mind for only you  
But you were still gone, gone, gone  
Been losing grip, sinking ships  
You showed up just in time  
  
[Chorus:]  
This love is good, this love is bad  
This love is alive back from the dead... oh oh oh  
These hands had to let it go free  
And this love came back to me... oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
This love left a permanent mark  
This love is glowing in the dark... oh oh oh  
These hands had to let it go free  
And this love came back to me  
  
[Bridge:]  
Your kiss, my cheek, unwashed, you leave  
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees  
When you're young you just run  
But you come back to what you need  
  
[Chorus:]  
This love is good, this love is bad  
This love is alive back from the dead  
These hands had to let it go free  
And this love came back to me  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
This love left a permanent mark  
This love is glowing in the dark  
These hands had to let it go free  
And this love came back to me

title: They Don't Know Us

They don't think our love will last.  
They say we're moving much to fast  
Just because our love is new.  
Doesn't mean it can't be true.  
Our love is young and so are we,  
I love you and you love me,  
But they don't believe us,  
Cause' they don't know us,  
They don't know us we can see,  
They won't listen to you and me,  
Instead of trying to change our plans,  
Why not give us a helping hand.  
Just like Juliette loved romeo,  
Sometimes others don't always know.  
But they won't help us,  
Cause they don't know us.  
  
Chorus  
  
Why not give us a chance and see,  
Just how true our love can be,  
They know you and they know me,  
But they don't know us,  
. (music turnaround)  
They say we're young and love is blind,  
We should give this some more time,  
  
Did they forget they were young like us,  
All we ask is a little trust.  
  
We love each other can't they see  
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be.  
They know you --and they know me,  
But they don' know us,  
Music intro  
I hope soon your folks and mine,  
Will get together and take the time,  
And get to know us,  
Really get to know us.  
Why not give us a chance ' and see  
Just how strong our love can be.  
They know you, and they know me,  
But they don't know us.  
Ooh woo a woo owho yeah  
They don't know us that's for sure,  
We're not their little children anymore.  
Just because our love is new,  
Doesn't mean it can't be true  
Why not give us a chance and see,  
How true love is suppose to be,  
They know you and they know me,  
But they don't know us...  
Yes they know you and they know me,  
But they just don't know us,

Should have been different but  
It wasn't different, was it  
Same old story, dear john,  
And so long  
Should have fit like a glove  
Should have fit like a ring  
Like a diamond ring  
A token of true love  
Should have all worked out  
But it didn't  
She should be here now  
But she isn't  
  
[Chorus:]  
There's your trouble,  
There's your trouble  
You keep seeing double  
With the wrong one  
You can't see I love you,  
You can't see she doesn't  
But you just keep holding on  
There's your trouble  
  
So now you're thinking 'bout  
All you're missing how  
Deep you're sinking,  
Round and round and dragging down  
Why don't you cash in your chips  
Why don't you call it a loss  
Not such a big loss,  
Chalk it up better luck  
Could have been true love  
But it wasn't  
It should all add up  
But it doesn't  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Should have all worked out  
But it didn't  
She should be here now  
But she isn't

He is sensible and so incredible  
And all my single friends are jealous  
He says everything I need to hear and it's like  
I couldn't ask for anything better  
He opens up my door and I get into his car  
And he says you look beautiful tonight  
And I feel perfectly fine  
  
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name  
You're so in love that you act insane  
And that's the way I loved you  
Breakin' down and coming undone  
It's a roller coaster kinda rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much  
And that's the way I loved you  
  
He respects my space  
And never makes me wait  
And he calls exactly when he says he will  
He's close to my mother  
Talks business with my father  
He's charming and endearing  
And I'm comfortable  
  
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name  
You're so in love that you act insane  
And that's the way I loved you  
Breakin' down and coming undone  
It's a roller coaster kinda rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much  
And that's the way I loved you  
  
He can't see the smile I'm faking  
And my heart's not breaking  
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all  
And you were wild and crazy  
Just so frustrating intoxicating  
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now  
  
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name  
I'm so in love that I acted insane  
And that's the way I loved you  
Breaking down and coming undone  
It's a roller coaster kinda rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much  
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh  
  
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh  
Never knew I could feel that much

I didn't know what I would find  
When I went looking for a reason, I know  
I didn't read between the lines  
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go  
I tried to take the road less traveled by  
But nothing seems to work the first few times  
Am I right?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So how can I ever try to be better?  
If nobody ever lets me in  
I can still see you, this ain't the best view  
On the outside looking in  
I've been a lot of lonely places  
I've never been on the outside  
  
You saw me there, but never knew  
I would give it all up to be  
A part of this, a part of you  
And now it's all too late so you see  
You could've helped if you had wanted to  
But no one notices until it's too  
Late to do anything  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
So how can I ever try to be better?

In the heat of the fight I walked away  
Ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay  
I said this time I've had enough  
And you've called a hundred times but I'm not picking up  
  
Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over  
But if you look a little closer  
  
I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming I'm in love with you  
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone  
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone  
I keep going back over things we both said  
And I remember the slamming door  
And all the things that I misread  
  
So baby, if you know everything  
Tell me why you couldn't see  
When I left I wanted you to chase after me  
  
I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming I'm in love with you  
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
And I'll scream out the window  
I can't even look at you  
I don't need you  
But I do, I do, I do  
I'll say there's nothing you can say  
To make this right again  
I mean it, I mean it  
What I mean is  
  
I said leave, but baby all I want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming I'm in love with you  
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
With your face and the beautiful eyes  
And the conversation with the little white lies  
And the faded picture of a beautiful night  
You carried me from your car up the stairs  
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess  
After everything and that little black dress  
After everything I must confess  
I need you

The Moment I Knew  
You should have been there, should have burst through the door, with that  
baby Im right here smile, and it would  
  
Have felt like, a million little shining stars that just aligned.  
And I would have been so happy  
Christmas lights glisten, Ive got my eye on the door, just waiting for you  
To walk in, but the time is ticking and  
  
People ask me how Ive been, as I comb back through my memory.  
  
How you said youd be here, you said youd be here.  
  
And it was like slow motion, standing there in my party dress, in red  
Lipstick, with no-one to impress, and theyre  
  
All laughing as Im looking around the room, and theres one thing missing  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
And the hours pass by, and I just want to be alone, but your close friends  
Always seem to know when theres  
  
Something really wrong, so they follow me down the hall, and there in the  
Bathroom I try not to fall apart, as the  
  
Sinking feeling starts, and I say hopelessly he said hed be here.  
  
And it was like slow motion, standing there in my party dress, in red  
Lipstick, with no-one to impress, and theyre  
  
All laughing and asking me all about you but theres one thing missing  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
What do you say when tears are streaming down your face in front of  
Everyone you know?  
  
And what do you do when the one who means the most to you is the one who  
Didnt show?  
  
You should have been here, and I would have been so happy.  
  
And it was like slow motion, standing there in my party dress, in red  
Lipstick, with no-one to impress, and theyre  
  
All sitting around me singing Happy Birthday To You and theres one thing  
Missingand that was the moment I knew.  
  
You called me later and said Im sorry I didnt make it, ' and I said, Im  
Sorry too. '  
  
And that was the moment I knew

New to town with a made up name in the angel city,  
Chasing fortune and fame.  
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.  
You had it figured out since you were in school.  
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.  
So overnight you look like a sixties queen.  
  
Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.  
  
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.  
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.  
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one.  
  
Now its big black cars, and Riviera views,  
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you  
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.  
  
And they tell you that youre lucky.  
But youre so confused,  
Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used.  
And all the young things line up to take your place.  
  
Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if youll make it out alive.  
  
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.  
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.  
Can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.  
  
It was a few years later, I showed up here.  
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,  
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.  
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,  
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,  
And it took some time, but I understand it now.  
  
Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,  
  
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.  
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.

Gary Lightbody:  
Found myself at your door,  
Just like all those times before,  
Im not sure how I got there,  
All roads they lead me here.  
  
I imagine you are home,  
In your room, all alone,  
And you open your eyes into mine,  
And everything feels better,  
  
Both:  
Right before your eyes,  
Im breaking and fast,  
No reasons why,  
Just you and me.  
  
This is the last time Im asking you this,

You break my heart in the blink of an eye.

Just for you to go again,  
Disappear when you come back,  
Everything is better.

title: The Best Day

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on  
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run  
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look now, the sky is gold  
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home  
  
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall  
But I know you're not scared of anything at all  
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away  
But I know I had the best day with you today  
  
I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean  
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys  
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away  
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names  
  
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school  
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you  
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay  
But I know I had the best day with you today  
  
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger  
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am  
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run  
And I had the best days with you  
  
There is a video I found from back when I was three  
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me  
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs  
And Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world  
  
And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall  
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong  
And I love you for giving me your eyes  
For staying back and watching me shine  
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm takin' this chance to say  
That I had the best day with you today

I said I know  
He said need some time, need some space  
To think about all of this  
I watched him go  
He watched me crushed to the floor  
On my knees, just like that  
  
He said, baby I'll come back  
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning  
That's when after sun is always storming  
Laughing when I'm crying  
That's when I'll be waiting up to fuckin'  
That's when I'll never see your face  
I let you in, baby that's when  
  
I said I know,  
He said I did you wrong, made mistakes  
Put you through all of this  
'Cause I let you go, you let me think  
That I'd be fun without you  
Imagine that!  
  
Baby I'll come back  
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning  
That's when after sun is always storming  
Laughing when I'm crying  
That's when I'll be waiting up to fuckin'  
That's when I'll never see your face  
I let you in, baby that's when  
  
And I said all this playing  
Did you ever think of me?  
And he said  
  
That's when I wake up in the morning  
That's when after sun is always storming  
Laughing when I'm crying!  
That's when we were waiting up to fuckin'  
That's when I'll never see your face  
I let you in, baby that's when  
  
I said I know

Drew looks at me  
I fake a smile so he won't see  
What I want and I need  
And everything that we should be  
  
I'll bet she's beautiful  
That girl he talks about  
And she's got everything  
That I have to live without  
  
Drew talks to me  
I have laugh 'cause it's just so funny  
I can't even see  
Anyone when he's with me  
  
He says he's so in love  
He's finally got it right  
I wonder if he knows  
He's all I think about at night  
  
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star  
He's the song in the car I keep singing  
Don't know why I do  
  
Drew walks by me  
Can he tell that I can't breathe?  
And there he goes, so perfectly  
The kind of flawless I wish I could be  
  
She better hold him tight  
Give him all her love  
Look in those beautiful eyes  
And know she's lucky 'cause  
  
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star  
He's the song in the car I keep singing  
Don't know why I do  
  
So I drive home alone  
As I turn out the light  
I'll put his picture down  
And maybe get some sleep tonight  
  
'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart  
He's the song in the car I keep singing  
Don't know why I do  
  
He's the time taken up but there's never enough  
And he's all that I need to fall into  
Drew looks at me  
I fake a smile so he won't see

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh  
Only sound, only sound, that you hear is "no"  
You never saw it coming  
Slipped when you started running  
And now you've come undone, and I, I, I, I  
  
Seen you fall, seen you crawl, on your knees, eh, eh  
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade  
Wish I could make it better  
Someday you won't remember,  
This pain you thought would last forever and ever  
  
[Chorus:]  
There you'll stand, ten feet tall  
I will say, "I knew it all along"  
Your eyes, wider than distance  
This life is sweeter than fiction  
  
Just a shot, just a shot, in the dark, oh, oh  
All you got, all you got, are your shattered hopes  
They never saw it coming  
You hit the ground running  
And now you're on to something  
I, I, I say  
  
What a sight, what a sight, when the light came on  
Proved me right, proved me right, when you proved them wrong  
And in this perfect weather  
It's like we don't remember  
The rain we thought would last forever and ever  
  
[Chorus:]  
There you'll stand, ten feet tall  
I will say, "I knew it all along"  
Your eyes, wider than distance  
This life is sweeter than fiction  
  
There you'll stand, next to me  
All at once, the rest is history  
Your eyes, wider than distance  
This life is sweeter than fiction (fiction)

I'll be one of the many saying  
Look at you now, look at you now, now  
I'll be one of the many saying  
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud  
  
I'll be one of the many saying  
Look at you now, look at you now, now  
I'll be one of the many saying  
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud  
  
And when they call your name  
And they put your picture in a frame  
You know that I'll be there time and again  
'Cause I loved you when  
  
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh

Tall dark and superman, he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away  
To save the world or go to work- it's the same thing to me  
He's got his mothers eyes, his fathers ambition  
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him  
I hang on every word you say, and you smile and say how are you?  
And I'll say just fine.  
I always forget to tell you I love you. I'll love you forever  
  
I watched Superman fly away  
You got a busy day today  
Go save the world  
I'll be around  
And I watched superman fly away  
Come back I'll be with you some day  
I'll be right here on the ground  
When you come back down  
  
Tall, dark and beautiful, he's complicated, he's irrational  
But I hope someday he'll take me away and save the day, yeh  
Something in his deep brown eyes has me saying,  
He's not all bad like his reputation  
And I can't hear one single word they say.  
You'll leave, got places to be and I'll be ok  
I always forget to tell you I love you  
I loved you from the very first day  
  
I watched Superman fly away  
You got a busy day today  
Go save the world, I'll be around  
And I watched Superman fly away  
Come back, I'll be with you someday  
I'll be right here on the ground  
When you come back down  
  
And I watch you fly around the world  
And I hope you don't take some other girl  
Don't forget, don't forget about me  
I'm far away but I never let you go  
I'm love struck and looking out the window  
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be  
Right here wishing the flowers were from you,  
Wishing the card was from you wishing the call was from you  
'Cause I've loved you from the very first day  
  
I watched Superman fly away  
You got a busy day today  
Go save the world, I'll be around  
Forever and ever  
And I watched Superman fly away  
I swear I'll be with you someday  
I'll be right here on the ground

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights  
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise

And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like

You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time  
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road  
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat

He says "What you've heard is true but I  
Can't stop thinking about you and I. "

title: Story Of Us

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,  
How we met  
And the sparks flew instantly  
And people would say they're the lucky ones  
  
I used to know my place was a spot next to you,  
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat  
Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on  
  
Oh, a simple complication,  
Miscommunications lead to fallout,  
So many things that I wish you knew  
So many walls up that I can't break through  
  
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dyin' to know  
Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me?  
Yeah  
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down  
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  
  
Next chapter  
  
How'd we end up this way?  
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy  
And you're doing your best to avoid me  
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us  
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here  
But you held your pride like you should have held me,  
Oh I'm scared to see the ending why are we pretending this is nothing  
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how  
I've never heard silence quite this loud.  
  
(Chorus)  
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me?  
Yeah  
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down  
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  
  
This is looking like a contest  
Of who can act like they care less  
But I liked it better when you were on my side  
  
The battle's in your hands now  
But I would lay my armor down  
If you say you'd rather love than fight  
  
So many things that you wish I knew  
But the story of us might be ending soon  
  
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me?  
Yeah  
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down  
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  
Now, Now, Now  
  
And we're not speaking,  
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me?  
Yeah  
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, cause we're going down.  
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  
The End

title: Stay Stay Stay

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night  
I threw my phone across the room at you  
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed  
This morning I said we should talk about it  
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved  
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet  
And said okay let's talk  
And I said...  
  
Stay stay stay I've been loving you for quite some time time time  
You think that it's funny when I'm mad mad mad  
But I think that it's best if we both stay  
  
Before you I only dated self indulgent takes who took all of their problems
out on me  
But you carrying my groceries and now I'm always laughing  
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to  
  
Stay stay stay I've been loving you for quite some time time time  
You think that it's funny when I'm mad mad mad  
But I think that it's best if we both stay stay stay stay  
  
You took the time to memorize me my feels my hopes and dreams  
I just like hanging out with you all the time  
All those times that you didn't leave it's been occuring to me I'd like to
hang out with you for my whole life  
  
Stay and i'll be loving you for quite some time  
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad  
So I think that it's best if we both stay stay stay stay  
  
Stay stay stay I've been loving you for quite some time time time  
You think that it's funny when I'm mad mad mad  
But I think that it's best if we both stay stay stay stay  
  
Stay stay stay I've been loving you for quite some time time time  
You think that it's funny when I'm mad mad mad  
But I think that it's best if we both stay

title: Stay Beautiful

Cory's eyes are like a jungle  
He smiles, it's like the radio  
He whispers songs into my window  
In words that nobody knows  
There's pretty girls on every corner  
They watch him as he's walking home  
Saying, does he know  
Will you ever know  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're beautiful  
Every little piece, love, don't you know  
You're really gonna be someone, ask anyone  
When you find everything you've looked for  
I hope your life leads you back to my door  
Oh but if it don't, stay beautiful  
  
Cory finds another way to be  
The highlight of my day  
I'm taking pictures in my mind  
So I can save them for a rainy day  
It's hard to make a conversation  
When he's taking my breathe away  
I should say, hey by the way...  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're beautiful  
Every little piece, love, don't you know  
You're really gonna be someone, ask anyone  
When you find everything you've looked for  
I hope your life leads you back to my door  
Oh but if it don't, stay beautiful  
  
If you and I are a story  
That never gets told  
If what you are is a daydream  
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know  
  
You're beautiful  
Every little piece, love, don't you know  
You're really gonna be someone, ask anyone  
When you find everything you've looked for  
I hope your life leads you back to my front door  
Oh but if it don't, stay beautiful  
  
Will you stay beautiful beautiful beautiful...  
Beautiful beautiful beautiful  
  
Ohh ohh ohhh  
  
Oh but if it don't  
Stay Beautiful

title: State Of Grace

Im walking fast through the traffic lights  
Busy streets and busy lives  
And all we know is touch and go  
We are alone with our changing minds  
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time  
  
And I never saw you coming  
And Ill never be the same  
  
You come around and the armor falls  
Pierce the room like a cannonball  
Now all we know... Is don't let go  
We are alone just you and me  
Up in your room, and our slates are clean  
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes  
So you were never a saint  
And Ive loved in shades of wrong  
We learn to live with the pain  
Mosaic broken hearts  
But this love is brave and wild  
  
And I never saw you coming  
And Ill never be the same  
  
This is a state of grace  
This is the worthwhile fight  
Love is a ruthless game  
Unless you play it good and right  
These are the hands of fate  
You're my Achilles heel  
This is the golden age of something good and right and real  
  
And I never saw you coming  
And Ill never be the same  
And I never saw you coming  
And Ill never be the same  
  
This is a state of grace  
This is the worthwhile fight  
Love is a ruthless game  
Unless you play it good and right

I said oh my, what a marvelous tune  
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved  
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing  
Like we're made of starlight  
Like we're made of starlight  
  
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45  
Picks me up, play one night at the window he was 17 and crazy, running wild
wild  
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in  
The night we snuck into a yacht club party  
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince  
  
And I said oh my, what a marvelous tune  
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved  
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing  
Like we're made of starlight starlight  
Like we're made of starlight starlight  
  
He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.  
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues, you keep thinking that way. "  
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me  
Don't you see the starlight starlight?  
Don't you dream impossible things?  
  
Like oh my, what a marvelous tune  
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved  
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing  
Like we're made of starlight starlight  
Like we're made of starlight starlight  
  
Ooh ooh he's talking crazy  
Ooh ooh dancing with me  
Ooh ooh we could get married  
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream  
  
[Guitar]  
  
Oh my, what a marvelous tune  
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved  
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we dream impossible dreams  
Like starlight, starlight  
Like we dream impossible dreams  
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?

You were the guy I always dreamed of.  
You were the guy that I loved. But then you had to leave me.  
I asked when you would call me.  
You replied meet me at the wildernes at nine.  
I went there standin waitin to see your face.  
... You never showed up I was there for hours,  
I was watin to see your face.  
I'll stand here for hours under this lonly spot light.  
  
I'll wait all night till I see your face.  
Ohh waitin to see your face.  
I went to the mall with all my friends to see if you  
Were there I saw you with another girl I didn't think  
To swear. I wen home crying to see if you were there  
If a message was left I would cry my tears.  
I was watin to see your face.  
I'll stand here for hours under this lonly spot light.  
I'll wait all night till I see your face.  
Ohh waitin to see your face.  
Then I had your call for me and I saw your face lookin  
At me I was glad to see! We went we cried to the the  
Wilderness I'm not alone.  
Under the spot light any more... Any more any more any more!

title: Speak Now

I am not the kind of girl  
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion  
But you are not the kind of boy  
Who should be marrying the wrong girl  
  
I sneak in and see your friends  
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel  
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid  
Somewhere back inside a room  
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry  
  
This is surely not what you thought it would be  
I lose myself in a daydream  
Where I stand and say  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't say "Yes", run away now  
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door  
Don't wait or say a single vow  
You need to hear me out  
And they said, "Speak now"  
  
Fond gestures are exchanged  
And the organ starts to play  
A song that sounds like a death march  
And I am hiding in the curtains  
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be  
  
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen  
But I know you wish it was me,  
You wish it was me,  
Don't you?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't say "Yes", run away now,  
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door.  
Don't wait or say a single vow,  
You need to hear me out,  
And they said, "Speak now".  
Don't say "Yes", run away now,  
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door.  
Don't wait or say a single vow,  
Your time is running out,  
And they said, "Speak now".  
  
Oh, la, la  
Oh, oh  
Say a single vow  
  
I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"  
There's the silence, there's my last chance.  
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.  
Horrified looks from everyone in the room  
But I'm only looking at you.  
  
I am not the kind of girl  
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion  
But you are not the kind of boy  
Who should be marrying the wrong girl  
  
[Chorus:]  
So, don't say "Yes", run away now,  
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door.  
Don't wait or say a single vow,  
You need to hear me out,  
And they said, "Speak now".  
And you'll say "Let's run away now,  
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door.  
Baby, I didn't say my vows,  
So glad you were around  
When they said, "Speak now".

title: Sparks Fly

The way you move is like a fall on rainstorm  
And I'm a house of cards  
You're the kinda reckless that should send me running but I  
Kinda know that I won't get far  
  
And you stood there in front of me just  
Close enough to touch  
Close enough so hope you couldn't see  
What I was thinking of  
  
[Chorus]  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
Get me with those green eyes, baby  
As the lights go down  
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around  
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
My mind forgets to remind me  
You're a bad idea  
You touch me once and it's really something  
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be  
  
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world  
But with you, I know it's no good  
And I could wait patiently but  
I really wish you would  
  
[Chorus]  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
Get me with those green eyes, baby  
As the lights go down  
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around  
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
I'll run my fingers through your hair  
And watch the lights go wild  
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me  
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right  
And meet me up the staircase  
Won't you whisper something slow  
I'm captivated by you, baby  
Like a firework show  
  
[Chorus]  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
Get me with those green eyes, baby  
As the lights go down  
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around  
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
And the sparks fly  
Oh, baby, smile  
And the sparks fly

Let's watch  
The tide chase  
The waves  
Onto the sand  
I wonder  
If a broken heart  
Feel the warmth  
On my hand  
And I wonder  
What a piece  
Of driftwood  
Has seen all through  
His lifetime  
Let's walk away  
The past through  
The smokey black nights  
  
I've seen  
A million things  
Spoke a million words  
Now I only want  
To speak to you  
  
Waiting for the words  
Counting every bird  
There's nothing  
I'd rather do  
On the  
Smokey black nights  
  
Still throught  
The haze  
I can make out  
Constellations  
I'll make one  
Of you and me  
As we sit  
In the sand  
And I saw  
That sunset gleamin  
As my eyes went wild  
Let's walk away  
The past through  
The smokey black nights  
  
I've played  
A thousand songs  
Sang a thousand words  
Now I only want  
To sing to you  
  
Waited on a wire  
Starin' at the fire  
There's nothing  
I'd rather do  
On the  
Smokey black nights  
  
I've walked  
A thousand miles  
Smiled  
A thousand smiles  
Now I only smile  
When I'm with you  
  
Waiting for the words  
Counting every bird  
There's nothing  
I'd rather do  
On the  
Smokey black nights  
  
So walk with me  
As the sweet  
Wind dances  
I'll write a song  
For you and me  
On the  
Smokey black nights

title: Should've Said No

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing  
The smiles, the flowers, everything  
Is gone  
Yesterday I found out about you  
Even now just looking at you  
Feels wrong  
You say  
That you'd take it all back,  
Given one chance  
It was a moment of weakness  
And you said yes  
  
You should've said no,  
You should've gone home  
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go  
You should've known the word of what you did with her'd  
Get back to me (get back to me)  
And I should've been there,  
In the back of your mind  
I shouldn't be asking myself why  
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet  
You should've said no,  
Baby and you might still have me  
  
You can see that I've been crying  
And baby you know all the right things  
To say  
But do you honestly expect me to believe  
We could ever be the same  
You say that the past is the past,  
You need one chance  
It was a moment of weakness  
And you said yes  
  
You should've said no,  
You should've gone home  
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go  
You should've known the word of what you did with her'd  
Get back to me (get back to me)  
And I should've been there,  
In the back of your mind  
I shouldn't be asking myself why  
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet  
You should've said no,  
Baby and you might still have meeeeeeeee  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I can't resist  
Before you go, tell me this  
Was it worth it?  
Was she worth this?  
  
Noooooooo, nooo  
No, no, noooooo, nooo...  
  
You should've said no,  
You should've gone home  
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go  
You should've known the word of what you did with her'd  
Get back to me (get back to me)  
And I should've been there,  
In the back of your mind

I remember you said "Don't leave me here alone",  
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight.  
  
[Chorus]  
Just close your eyes,  
The sun is going down.  
You'll be alright,  
No one can hurt you now.  
Come morning light,  
You and I'll be safe and sound.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Don't you dare look out your window,  
Darlin' everything's on fire.  
The war outside our door keeps raging on.  
Hold onto this lullaby,  
Even when the music's gone,  
Gone.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Just close your eyes,  
The sun is going down.  
You'll be alright,  
No one can hurt you now.  
Come morning light,  
You and I'll be safe and sound.  
  
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Just close your eyes,  
You'll be alright.  
Come morning light,  
You and I'll be safe and sound.  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
Oohhh.

title: Sad Beautiful Tragic

Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket  
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late  
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket  
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait  
  
We had...  
A beautiful, magic love there  
What a sad...  
Beautiful, tragic love affair  
  
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation  
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities  
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you  
And you've got your demons, and darling  
They all look like me, 'cause  
  
We had...  
A beautiful, magic love there  
What a sad...  
Beautiful, tragic love affair  
  
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting  
Silence, the train runs off its tracks  
Kiss me, try to fix it  
Could you just try to listen?  
Hang up, give up and for the life of us  
We can't get back...  
  
A beautiful magic love there  
What a sad...  
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic  
Beautiful...  
  
We had...  
A beautiful, magic love there  
What a sad...  
Beautiful, tragic love affair  
  
We had...  
A beautiful, magic love there  
What a sad...  
Beautiful, tragic love affair

title: Run

If there's a plane or a bus leaving dallas  
I hope you're on it  
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks  
I hope you caught it  
  
Cause I swear out there ain't where you ought to be  
So catch a ride, catch a cab  
Don't you know I miss you bad  
But don't you walk to me  
  
Baby run, cut a path across the blue skies  
Straight in a straight line  
You can't get here fast enough  
  
Find a truck and fire it up  
Lean on the gas and off the clutch  
Leave dallas in the dust  
I need you in a rush  
So baby run  
  
If you ain't got a suit case  
Get a box or an old brown paper sack  
And pack it light or pack it heavy  
Take a truck, take a chevy  
Baby just come back  
  
There's a shortcut to the highway out of town  
Why don't you take it  
Don't let that speed limit slow you down  
Go on and break it  
  
Baby run, cut a path across the blue skies  
Straight in a straight line  
You can't get here fast enough  
  
Find a truck and fire it up  
Lean on the gas and off the clutch  
Leave dallas in the dust  
I need you in a rush  
So baby run  
  
Baby run  
Oh baby run  
Baby run

title: Ronan

I remember your bare feet down the hallway  
I remember your little laugh  
Race cars on the kitchen floor  
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back  
  
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club  
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up  
I can still feel you hold my hand  
Little man, even from that moment I knew  
You fought it hard like an army guy  
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you  
  
Chorus:  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
I remember the drive home when the blind hope  
Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"  
Flowers piled up in the worst way  
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died  
  
And it's about to be Halloween  
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here  
I remember the last day when I kissed your face  
I whispered in your ear  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey  
We'll just disappear  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?  
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?  
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?  
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
I remember your bare feet down the hallway  
I love you to the moon and back

title: Ride Of Our Lives

It's 10am, I catch the morning train,  
  
And there you are, you smile, with a seat you've saved,  
  
Saying "hey, i've been waiting for ya".  
  
We'd talk about our dreams, you'd talk 'bout everything,  
  
We'd go so loud, but we don't care,  
  
Cause all we care is that we're having so much fun.  
  
You'd tell me 'bout your life, you'd learn a bit 'bout mine,  
  
And just like that I swear it's like we've known each other our whole lives.  
  
  
  
And this moment is perfect.  
  
Train tracks grind still everyone can hear us.  
  
Don't you dare be quiet.  
  
This journey's ours, yeah this journey's ours.  
  
  
  
  
Lets take the ride of our lives.  
  
This is the moment where the chemistry happens,  
  
Yeah that special connection.  
  
These are the days of our lives.  
  
These are the times you'll never forget.  
Never regret as long as we ride here side by side.  
  
We can speak, we can dream,  
  
This is our time, you and me,  
  
Lets have the ride of our lives.  
  
  
  
As we watch the world outside the window past,  
  
I'd pray, hoping that this moment lasts.  
  
It's hard not to laugh out loud baby when you crack a joke.  
  
You've got me smiling, got me thinking that I've got it all.  
  
You make a promise to me; promise this will be our tradition,  
  
Cause every time we ride together it's like stranger than fiction.  
  
I don't ever want this train ride to come to an end,  
  
But when it does baby, we can do it all over again.  
  
  
And the train's coming to a stop,  
  
I'm still so lost in you I can't bare to get off.  
  
You kiss me on the spot.  
  
"See you tomorrow, yeah tomorrow we can"

title: Revenge

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did  
Ha, time for a little revenge  
  
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer  
And, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him  
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause  
She took him faster than you could say sabotage  
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it  
I underestimated just who I was dealing with  
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum  
She underestimated just who she was stealing from  
  
She's not a saint and she's not what you think  
She's an actress, whoa  
She's better known for the things that she does  
On the mattress, whoa  
Soon she's gonna find  
Stealing other people's toys on the playground  
Won't make you many friends  
She should keep in mind,  
She should keep in mind  
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha  
  
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list  
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it  
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling  
And, she thinks I'm psycho  
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but  
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know  
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go  
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school  
So it's up to me  
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity  
(Think about what you did)  
  
She's not a saint and she's not what you think  
She's an actress, whoa  
She's better known for the things that she does  
On the mattress, whoa  
Soon she's gonna find  
Stealing other people's toys on the playground  
Won't make you many friends  
She should keep in mind,  
She should keep in mind  
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha  
  
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey  
You might have him, but haven't you heard  
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey  
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word  
Whoa  
  
She's not a saint and she's not what you think  
She's an actress, whoa  
She's better known for the things that she does  
On the mattress, whoa  
Soon she's gonna find  
Stealing other people's toys on the playground  
Won't make you many friends  
She should keep in mind,  
She should keep in mind  
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha  
  
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,  
'Cause I don't think you do, oh  
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing  
I don't think you do, I don't think you do  
Let's hear the applause  
C'mon show me how much better you are  
See you deserve some applause  
'Cause you're so much better  
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

title: Red

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street  
Faster than the wind  
Passionate as sin, ended so suddenly  
Loving him is like trying to change your mind  
Once you're already flying through the free fall  
Like the colors in autumn  
So bright just before they lose it all  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark grey all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met  
But loving him was red  
Loving him was red  
  
Touching him is like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of
you  
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song  
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's
no right answer  
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out love could be that strong  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark grey all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met  
But loving him was red  
Oh red burning red  
  
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes  
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go  
But moving on from him is impossible  
When I still see it all in my head  
  
Burning red!  
Darling it was red!  
  
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark grey all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met  
Cause loving him was red yeah yeah red  
We're burning red  
  
And that's why he's spinning round in my head  
Comes back to me burning red  
Yeah yeah  
  
Cause love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street.

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy,

So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy,  
That's fine you won't mind if I say.  
And by the way

I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive.  
You're a redneck heartbreak,  
Who's really bad at lying.  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time,  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn.

There's no time for tears, I'm just sitting here  
Planning my revenge.  
There's nothing stopping me

And if you come around saying sorry to me,  
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be.

Cleanin up that mess.

If you love me, then I love you  
Swear by the freckles on the moon  
And maybe this will be enough  
I'd like to keep you til I'm old  
But if I can't at least you'll know

Oh, oh

Before September stole me away from you  
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek  
Cause baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me  
  
Sayin' if you love me, then I love you  
I swear by the freckles on the moon  
And maybe this will be enough  
I'd like to keep you til I'm old  
But if I can't at least you'll know  
That baby, perfect have I loved  
  
I can still see it, that old little bridge we used to cross  
I finally made it, trying to get lost  
You would smile that smile and I'd try so hard to forget  
Cause of all the little fires that I still haven't put out yet  
  
And if you love me, then I love you  
I swear by the freckles on the moon  
And maybe this will be enough  
I'd like to keep you til I'm old  
But if I can't at least you'll know  
That baby, perfect have I loved  
  
Love was all we knew  
And faith was growing on the vine  
Words were all we knew  
And for one summer you were mine  
  
If you love me, then I love you  
I swear by the freckles on the moon  
And maybe this will be enough  
I'd like to keep you til I'm old  
But if I can't at least you'll know

title: Out Of The Woods

[Verse:]  
Looking at it now, it all seems so simple  
We were lying on your couch, I remember!  
You took a Polaroid of us  
Then discovered (Then discovered)  
The rest of the world was black and white  
But we were in screaming color  
And I remember thinking  
  
[Chorus:]  
Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods yet?

In the clear yet, good.  
Are we out of the woods?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Looking at it now, Last December  
we were built to fall apart, then fall back together  
Your necklace hanging from my neck, the night we couldn't quite forget  
When we decided (We decided)  
To move the furniture so we could dance  
Baby, like we stood a chance  
Two paper airplanes flying, flying  
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods?  
Are we in the clear yet?  
Are we in the clear yet?

Are we in the clear yet?  
In the clear yet, good.  
  
Are we out of the woods?  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon  
Twenty stitches in a hospital room  
When you started crying  
Baby, I did too  
But when the sun came up  
I was looking at you  
Remember when we couldn't take the heat  
I walked out, I said "I'm setting you free"  
But the monsters turned out to be just trees  
When the sun came up  
You were looking at me  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
You were looking at me  
Oh!  
You were looking at me.  
Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods yet?

title: Ours

Elevator buttons and morning air  
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs  
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares  
But right now, my time is theirs  
  
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves  
They'll judge it like they know about me and you  
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do  
The jury's out, but my choice is you  
  
So don't you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
And life makes love look hard  
The stakes are high  
The waters rough  
But this love is ours  
  
You never know what people have up their sleeves  
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me  
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles  
But I don't care, cause right now you're mine  
  
And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
And life makes love look hard  
The stakes are high  
The waters rough  
But this love is ours  
  
And it's not theirs to speculate  
If it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and  
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you  
  
Cause I love the gap between your teeth  
And I love the riddles that you speak  
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored  
Cause my heart is yours  
  
So don't you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
And life makes love look hard  
  
So don't you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
But they can't take what's ours  
They can't take what's ours  
The stakes are high  
The waters rough  
But this love is ours

title: Our Song

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone  
In the front seat of his car  
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel  
The other on my heart  
  
I look around, turn the radio down  
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"  
I say, "Nothing I was just thinking  
How we don't have a song" and he says  
  
Our song is the slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow  
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
  
Our song is the way you laugh  
The first date man, I didn't kiss her and I should have  
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen  
Asking God if He could play it again  
  
I was walking up the front porch steps  
After everything that day  
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on  
And lost and thrown away  
  
Got to the hallway, well, on my way  
To my lovin' bed  
I almost didn't notice all the roses  
And the note that said  
  
Our song is the slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow  
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
  
Our song is the way you laugh  
The first date man, I didn't kiss her and I should have  
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen  
Asking God if He could play it again  
  
I've heard every album, listened to the radio  
Waited for something to come along  
That was as good as our song  
  
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window  
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow  
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know  
  
Our song is the way he laughs  
The first date man, I didn't kiss him and I should have  
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen  
Asking God if He could play it again  
Play it again, oh, yeah, oh, oh, yeah  
  
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone  
In the front seat of his car  
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin  
And I wrote down our song

T A are  
T N A  
E  
Are  
  
We were standing in an empty room  
The moonlight was falling  
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you  
And I could have spent a life with you  
But those days were over  
You were calling my name when your face faded from view  
  
And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
And wasn't it you who told me:  
  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
  
I remember waking up with you  
The days doing nothing  
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.  
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star  
A poet at a Nobel seminar  
I hope the world never tore that out of you  
  
Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
Yeah wasn't it you who told me:  
  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
  
And what ever happened to the things you loved  
And the songs we played, and the indian days  
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?  
Like Harold and Maude and singing  
Like Harold and Maude and singing  
  
I was waving as you drove away  
The sunlight was falling  
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane  
  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?

title: One Way Ticket

Standing on the border  
Looking out into the great unknown  
I can feel my heart beating faster  
As I step out on my own  
There's a new horizon  
And the promise of favorable wind  
I'm heading out tonight,  
Traveling light  
I'm gonna start all over again  
  
And buy a one-way ticket  
On a west bound train  
See how far I can go  
Cause I'm gonna go out  
Dancing in the pouring rain  
And talk to someone I don't know  
I will face the world around me  
Knowing that I'm strong enough  
To let you go  
And I will fall in love again  
Because I can  
  
Gonna climb the mountain  
And look the eagle in the eye  
I won't let fear clip my wings  
And tell me how high I can fly  
How could I have ever believed  
That love had to be so blind  
When freedom was waiting, d  
Own at the station  
All I had to do  
Was make up my mind  
  
And buy a one-way ticket  
On a west bound train  
See how far I can go  
Cause I'm gonna go out  
Dancing in the pouring rain  
And talk to someone I don't know  
I will face the world around me  
Knowing that I'm strong enough  
To let you go  
And I will fall in love again  
Because I can  
  
Well,  
I have walked through the fire  
And crawled on my knees  
Through the valley  
Of the shadow of doubt  
Then the truth came shining  
Like a light on me  
And now I can see my way out  
  
Buy a one-way ticket  
On a west bound train  
See how far I can go  
Cause I'm gonna go out  
Dancing in the pouring rain  
And talk to someone I don't know  
  
Buy a one-way ticket  
On a west bound train  
I'm gonna have my breakfast  
With some pink champagne  
Gonna sail the ocean,  
Gonna spread my wings  
Gonna climb that mountain,  
Gonna do everything

title: One Thing

It wasn't just like a movie  
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin  
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say  
This is the last time I'll drive this way again  
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray  
Cause I, I still love you but I can't  
  
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side  
Bye, bye, baby  
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing  
And all you have is to walk away  
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah  
  
The picture frame is empty  
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me  
I take your photo off the dash  
And back to the conversation  
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have  
I'm lost in the sound of it  
But here in the now comes in  
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past  
  
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side  
Bye, bye, baby  
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing  
And all you have is to walk away  
From the one thing I thought would never leave me  
  
And there's so much that I can't touch  
You're all I want but it's not enough this time  
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands  
And I'm so scared of how this ends  
  
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side  
Bye, bye, baby  
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing  
And all you have is to walk away  
From the one thing I thought would never leave me  
  
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side  
Bye, bye, baby  
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing

title: Oh My My My

She said: I was seven and you were nine  
I looked at you like the stars that shine  
In the sky, the pretty lights  
  
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us  
Growin up and fallin in love  
And our mamas smiled  
And rolled their eyes  
And said oh my, my, my...  
  
Take me back to the house with the backyard tree  
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me  
You never did  
You never did  
Take me back when our world was one block wide  
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried  
Just two kids  
You and I  
Oh my my my my  
  
Well I was sixteen when suddeny  
I wasn't that little girl you used to see  
But your eyes still shined  
Like pretty lights.  
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us  
They never believed we'd really fall in love  
And our mamas smiled  
And rolled their eyes  
And said oh my, my, my  
  
Take me back to the creek those weeks in love  
Two am ridin in your truck  
And all I need  
Is you next to me  
Take me back to the time we had our very fist fight  
The slammin of doors 'stead of kissin goodnight  
You stayed outside  
Til the morning light  
Oh my, my, my, my  
  
A few years head gone and come around  
We were sittin at our favorite spot in town  
And you looked at me  
Got down on one knee  
  
Take me back to the time  
When we walked down the aisle  
The whole town came and our mamas cried  
You said I do  
And I did too  
Took me home where we met so many years before  
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch  
After all this time  
You and I  
  
I'll be 87 you'll be 89  
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine  
In the sky  
Oh my, my, my...

(Talking)  
Wow it's been at least 5 years since I've seen her. Pfft it's hard to believe  
(Start singing)  
I can't believe it's been that long, why didn't your call, why didn't you
write. Was it cause of him or was it just cause you don't love me anymore. You
could have found some way o contact me.  
[Chorus:]  
But I know it's not my falt  
Once he's gone I know you'll start to come around  
I know it's his fault now, you should have told me sooner, I wouldn't have had
to live my life this way  
(Sing softly)  
Now that he's gone will I get to see you again  
At least hear your voice again I think it's gonna workout this time around  
We can be a family again not like before is gonna e different,  
Were gonna do lots of stuff togeather I think it's gonna work out this time
around not like before  
[Chorus:]  
But I know it's not my fault  
Once he's gone I know you'll start to come around  
I know it's his fault now, you should have told me sooner I wouldn't have had

title: New Romance

[Verse:]  
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything  
We wait for trains that just aren't coming  
We show off our different scarlet letters  
Trust me, mine is better  
We're so young, we're on the road to ruin  
We play dumb we know exactly what we're doing  
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom  
Honey life is just a class room  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause baby I could build a castle  
Out of all the bricks they threw at me  
And everyday is like a battle  
But every night with us is like a dream  
We're the new romantics  
Come along with me  
Heartbreak is the national anthem  
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet  
Baby were the new romantics  
The best people in life are free  
  
[Verse 2:]  
We're all here the lights and boy are blinding  
We hang back its all in the timing  
It's poker, you can't see it in my face  
But I'm about to play my Ace  
We need love but all we want is danger  
We team up and switch up like a record changer  
The rumors are terrible and cruel  
But honey most of them are true  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause baby I could build a castle  
Out of all the bricks they threw at me  
And everyday is like a battle  
But every night with us is like a dream  
We're the new romantics  
Come along with me  
Heartbreak is the national anthem  
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet  
Baby were the new romantics  
The best people in life are free  
  
Please take my hand and  
Please take me dancing and  
Please leave me stranded  
It's so romantic, so romantic  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause baby I could build a castle  
Out of all the bricks they threw at me  
And everyday is like a battle  
But every night with us is like a dream  
We're the new romantics  
Come along with me  
Heartbreak is the national anthem  
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet  
Baby were the new romantics  
The best people in life are free  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause baby I could build a castle  
Out of all the bricks they threw at me  
And everyday is like a battle  
But every night with us is like a dream

Look at you, look at me  
Look at who we could be  
I wanna know who you are  
Watch you from the stars  
  
And everytime I look at you  
I can hardly say a thing  
My head starts to spin  
And it hits me then, I love you  
  
And everytime you look at me  
I could go crazy but I don't  
Say it but I won't  
Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you  
  
And all I really wanna do is be next to you  
But I'm too tired to fight  
And I could tell you now  
But baby, never mind  
  
All the time, everyday  
There's nothing I can do, baby  
To make it go away  
So look at you and look at me  
I think of who we could be  
  
And everytime I look at you  
I can hardly say a thing  
My head starts to spin  
And it hits me then, I love you  
  
And everytime you look at me  
I could go crazy but I don't  
Say it but I won't  
Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you  
  
And all I really wanna do is be next to you  
But I'm too tired to fight  
And I could tell you now  
But never mind  
  
All I really wanna say is I need you, babe  
But how could you understand?  
What happens when you turn away?  
And everything turns blue and gray  
And I just wish I told you never mind  
And I could tell you now  
But baby, never mind  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh yeah

title: Never Grow Up

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger  
And it's so quiet in the world tonight  
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming  
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light  
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret  
I'd give all I have, honey  
If you could stay like that  
  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple  
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart  
And no one will desert you  
Just try to never grow up, never grow up  
  
You're in the car on the way to the movies  
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off  
At 14 there's just so much you can't do  
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots  
But don't make her drop you off around the block  
Remember that she's getting older too  
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for
school  
  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple  
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred  
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up  
  
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room  
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home  
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said  
And all your little brother's favorite songs  
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone  
  
So here I am in my new apartment  
In a big city, they just dropped me off  
It's so much colder that I thought it would be  
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on  
  
Wish I'd never grown up  
I wish I'd never grown up  
  
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up  
I could still be little  
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up  
It could still be simple  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple  
Won't let nobody hurt you  
Won't let no one break your heart  
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up  
Oh, don't you ever grow up  
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

title: Nashville

On a crowded highway  
Through a night alone  
I was barely breathing  
I was crawling home  
Well, it's quite not London  
Or the south of France  
Or an Asian Island  
Or a second chance  
  
Going back to Nashville  
Thinking 'bout the whole thing  
Guess you gotta run sometimes  
Maybe I'm a fast train  
Blowin' through a valley  
Watching all my life go by  
  
You're a distant memory  
You're an exit sign  
I was talking crazy  
On the drivers side  
And I know I hurt you  
But I can't confess  
Was that blood or a wine stain  
On your wedding dress  
  
Going back to Nashville  
Thinking 'bout the whole thing  
Guess you gotta run sometimes  
Maybe I'm a fast train  
Blowing through a mountain  
Watching all my life go by  
  
Going back to Nashville  
Laughing at a bad break  
What's the use of wondering why?  
Maybe I'm a storm front  
Blowing through a valley  
Tearing up a good July  
  
And its safe and warm  
Where nothing ever happens  
Could it be so hard  
To realign a star or two  
Change a southern night for you  
  
Going back to Nashville  
Thinking bout the whole thing  
Guess you gotta run sometimes  
Maybe I'm a fast train  
Blowing though a valley  
Tearing up a good July  
  
I'm going back to Nashville  
Laughing at a bad break  
What's the use of wondering why?  
Maybe I'm a storm front  
Blowing through the valley  
Tearing up a good July  
  
Going back to Nashville  
  
I'm going back to Nashville  
  
Going back to Naaaaahh....  
  
Going back to Nashville  
What's the use of wondering why?

Verse 1:  
I don't want to break your heart  
But you just keep on pushing me  
I want to walk away  
But you have ways of stopping me  
I don't know what to say  
It's just that I really want to leave  
Cause your holding me back, holding me back from the life of luxury  
  
Chorus:  
So let me go my own way  
Opposite from you  
I don't care what you have to say  
My hearts not in the mood  
Though I really love you  
You just keep hurting me  
You say tell you what to do to make me happy  
The only way is for you to let me leave  
  
Verse 2:  
When ever we go out  
I'm just a friend to you  
But when we at home  
You want to call me your boo  
An I hate the fact  
That when she comes around you make me go away  
It's like you can't make up your mind  
This is all I have to say  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge:  
You say I can count on you  
But you just playing games  
An I just let it slide  
When call her name  
You don't get it

But see now I'm tired of your two faces  
So I'm just going to go my own way

I know we've got a lot to say  
Between now and forever  
But I'd be a game if you would play  
And I dare this to get better  
  
Somewhere throughout the day  
You smile and walk away  
All I can think to do  
Is follow you  
  
If you ever leave I'll be crawlin' back for more  
If you ever need love I'm standin' at your door  
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure  
  
Wherever you think I am tonight  
Just know we're that miles from a heartbreak  
Beacause in the blink of a pretty brown eye  
I'll be right where you are baby  
  
Sometime along the way you take my breath away  
Distracted by the view  
I fall right into you  
  
And if you ever leave I'll be crawlin' back for more  
And if you ever need love I'm standin' at your door  
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure  
  
They say I need to see all the people out there waitin'  
But you take one look at me  
And I know the mistake I'll be makin'  
  
Cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawlin' back for more  
And if you ever need my love I'm standin' at your door  
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

Everytime  
I think of you  
I always catch  
My breath  
I'm still  
Standing here  
And your miles away  
And I wonder why  
You left me  
And there's a storm  
That's raging through  
My frozen heart tonight  
  
Tyler:  
I hear your name  
In certain circles  
And it always  
Makes me smile  
I spent my time  
Just thinkin'  
About you  
And it's almost  
Driving me wild  
  
But it's my heart  
That's beggin down  
This long distance  
Line tonight  
  
Taylor/Tyler:  
And I  
Ain't missin' you  
At all  
Since you've  
Been gone away  
I ain't missin' you  
No matter

There's a message  
In the wires  
And I am sendin' you  
A signal tonight  
You don't know  
How desperate  
I've become  
And It looks  
Like I'm loosein'  
This fight  
  
But it's my heart  
That's breakin' down  
This long dusty  
Road of mine  
  
But I ain't  
Missin' you  
At all  
Since you've  
Been gone away  
I aint missin' you at  
No matter  
What my friends say  
  
Taylor:  
And there's a message  
That I'm sendin' out  
Like a telograph  
To you or something  
I can't bridge  
This distance  
Honey  
Stop this heart  
Ache all alone  
  
Taylor/Tyler:  
I ain't missin' you  
At all  
Since you've  
Been gone away  
I ain't missin' you  
No matter  
What my friends say  
I ain't missin' you  
Since you've  
Been gone away  
I ain't missin' you  
Yeah, no matter  
What your friends say  
  
Hey, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I ain't missin' you  
At all  
Since you've  
Been gone away  
I ain't missin' you  
Nooo

title: Mine

You were in college working part time waiting tables  
Left the small town, never looked back  
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling  
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts  
I say can you believe it?  
As we're lying on the couch  
The moment I can see it  
Yes, yes, I can see it now  
  
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?  
You put your arm around me for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing that's ever been mine  
  
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together  
And there's a drawer of my things at your place  
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded  
You said we'll never make my parents' mistakes  
But we got bills to pay  
We got nothing figured out  
When it was hard to take  
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about  
  
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?  
You put your arm around me for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing that's ever been mine  
  
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?  
You saw me start to believe for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing that's ever been mine  
  
Oh oh ohh  
And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.  
As everything was slipping right out of our hands  
And I ran out crying and you followed me out into the streets  
Braced myself for the goodbye  
'Cause that's all I've ever known  
And you took me by surprise  
You said I'll ever leave you alone  
  
You said  
I remember how we felt sitting by the water  
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time  
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter  
She is the best thing that's ever been mine  
  
(Hold on, make it last)  
(Hold on, never turn back)  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing that's ever been mine  
(Yes, yes), Do you believe it?  
(Yes, yes), We're gonna make it now  
(Yes, yes) and I can see it  
I can see it now

title: Mean

You, with your words like knives,  
And swords and weapons that you use against me.  
  
You, have knocked me off my feet again,  
Got me feeling like a nothing.  
  
You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board, calling me out when I'm
wounded.  
  
You, picking on the weaker man.  
  
You can take me downnn,  
With just one single blow~  
  
But you don't know,  
What you don't know!  
  
Someday, I'll be, living in a big ol' city,  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.  
Someday, I'll be, big enough so you can't hit me,  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.  
  
Why you gotta be so mean?  
  
You, with your switching sides,  
And your wildfire lies, and your humiliation.  
  
You, have pointed out my flaws again.  
As if I don't already see them.  
  
I walk with my head down,  
Trying to block you out, cause I'll never impress you.  
I just want to feel okay again.  
  
I bet you got pushed around~  
Somebody made you cold.  
But the cycle ends right now.  
Because you can't lead me down that road.  
  
And you don't know,  
What you don't know.  
  
Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city,  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.  
Someday I'll be,  
Big enough so you can't hit me.  
  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.  
  
Why you gotta be so mean?  
  
And I can see you years from now, in a bar,  
Talking over a football game.  
With that same big loud opinion,  
But nobody's listening.  
  
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things.  
Drunk and grumbling on about,  
How I can't sing.  
  
But all you are is mean.  
  
All you are is mean,  
And a liar,  
And pathetic,  
And alone in life.  
  
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean!  
  
But someday I'll be living in a big ol' city,  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.  
YEAH-EAH!  
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me,  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.  
  
Why you gotta be so mean?  
  
Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city,  
(Why you gotta be so mean)  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.  
(Why you gotta be so mean)  
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me,  
(Why you gotta be so mean)  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.  
  
Why you gotta be so mean?

I am moving through the crowd  
Trying to find myself  
Feel like a guitar that's never played  
Will someone strum away?  
  
And I ask myself  
Who do I wanna be?  
Do I wanna throw away the key?  
And invent a whole new me  
And I tell myself  
No One, No One  
Don't wanna be  
No One  
But me..  
  
You are moving through the crowd  
Trying to find yourself  
Feelin' like a doll left on a shelf  
Will someone take you down?  
  
And you ask yourself  
Who do I wanna be?  
Do I wanna throw away the key?  
And invent a whole new me  
Gotta tell yourself  
No One, No One  
Don't wanna be  
No One  
But me..  
  
Your life plays out on the shadows of the wall  
You turn the light on to erase it all  
You wonder what it's like to not feel worthless  
So open all the blinds and all the curtains  
  
No One, No One  
Don't wanna be  
No One  
But me..  
  
We are moving through the crowd...

I shined your shoes, I poured the wine, I gave you all of my time,  
I patched your dance smile that your friends apparently is a crime  
I gave you strength, you took my place and gave it to her  
But last... There was love on the...  
And when love hands me matches now I'm gonna burn it down.  
  
I keyed her car, got my guitar and wrote this damn song,  
Look what you found she's been around I hear the line's long  
And don't you tell me to be nice, I'm not a nice girlshe died of complications
from the things you told her  
So when love hands me matches now I'm gonna burn it down.  
  
Any funny you said honey you... Dark,  
But I say cheater, liar, truck on fire, looser, lavor to see...

Your feet under the table  
I love it when they're touching mine  
Your hands make the best kind of cradle  
To tell me everything is fine  
All I see is you looking at me  
  
Do you know when you go  
You make the sweetest sight at the window  
If you had never come out of the blue  
I would have stayed up and Made Up You  
  
You smile just like a picture  
It doesn't even need a frame  
Sometimes I wait to answer  
Just to hear you say my name  
And all I want is just what I've got  
  
Do you know when you go  
You make the sweetest sight at the window  
If you had never come out of the blue  
I would have stayed up and Made Up You  
  
I'd never let you go  
Even If I could  
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good  
  
Oh oh  
  
Do you know when you go  
You make the sweetest sight at the window  
If you had never come out of the blue

title: Lucky You

There's a little girl  
In this little town  
With a little too much heart  
To go around  
Live forever,  
Never say never  
You can do better,  
That's what she says  
  
Mama named her Lucky  
On a starlight night  
A rabbit foot in her pocket,  
She dances in spite of  
The fact that she's different  
And yet she's the same  
And she says do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Lucky you, lucky you  
Do do do do do do do do  
  
She sings her little songs  
She walks a long a little  
Halfway headed for the skies  
Left to travel,  
Lives they unravel  
Mind over matter,  
That's what she says  
  
Mama named her Lucky  
On a starlit night  
A rabbit foot in her pocket,  
She dances in spite of  
The fact that she's different  
And yet she's the same  
And she says do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do do do do  
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you  
Do do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do do do do  
  
Maybe she'll sing you do do do  
Maybe she'll bring you  
Into the skies  
Honey, she'll love you  
Funny how some view  
Angels above you,  
Aint so far away.

title: Love Story

[Verse 1]  
We were both young when I first saw you  
I close my eyes  
And the flashback starts  
I'm standing there  
On a balcony in summer air  
See the lights  
See the party, the ball gowns  
See you make your way through the crowd  
And say hello, little did I know  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles  
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet  
And I was crying on the staircase  
Begging you please don't go, and I said  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
  
[Verse 2]  
So I sneak out to the garden to see you  
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew  
So close your eyes  
Escape this town for a little while  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter  
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet  
But you were everything to me  
I was begging you please don't go and I said  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
  
Romeo save me, they're tryin to tell me how to feel  
This love is difficult, but it's real  
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
  
Oh oh  
  
[Bridge]  
I got tired of waiting  
Wondering if you were ever coming around  
My faith in you was fading  
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said  
  
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone  
I keep waiting for you but you never come  
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think  
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Marry me Juliet  
You'll never have to be alone  
I love you and that's all I really know  
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, oh,  
Oh, oh  
Cause we were both young when I first saw you...

title: Long Live

I said remember this moment  
In the back of my mind  
The time we stood with our shaking hands  
The crowds in stands went wild  
  
We were the kings and the queens  
And they read off our names  
The night you danced like you knew our lives  
Would never be the same  
You held your head like a hero  
On a history book page  
It was the end of a decade  
But the start of an age  
  
Long live the walls would crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"  
And bring on all the pretenders, one day we will be remembered  
  
I said remember this feeling  
I passed the pictures around  
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines  
Wishing for right now  
  
We are the kings and the queens  
You trade your baseball cap for a crown  
When they gave us our trophies  
And we held them up for our town  
  
And the cynics were outraged  
Screaming, "this is absurd"  
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves  
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world  
  
Long live the walls would crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"  
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid  
  
Long live all the mountains we moved  
I had the time of my life  
Fighting dragons with you  
I was screaming, "long live the look on your face"  
And bring on all the pretenders, One day we will be remembered  
  
Hold on to spinning around  
Confetti falls to the ground  
May these memories break our fall  
  
Can you take a moment  
Promise me this:  
That you'll stand by me forever  
But if God forbid fate should step in  
And force us into a goodbye  
If you have children someday  
When they point to the pictures  
Please tell 'em my name  
Tell them how the crowds went wild  
Tell them how I hope they shine  
  
Long live the walls would crashed through  
I had the time of my life with you  
  
Long, long live the walls would crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
And I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"  
And bring on all the pretenders  
I'm not afraid  
  
Singing long live all the mountains we moved  
I had the time of my life  
Fighting dragons with you  
  
And long, long live the look on your face  
And bring on all the pretenders  
One day we will be remembered

title: Live For The Little Things

One day break, one heart ache, every once upon a time  
That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines  
They mean so much to everyone,  
But you count them up one by one  
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall  
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall  
Your black boots, my red flower ring  
They're for the little things  
  
Oil paintings and make it, every details turned out bad  
One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person  
It means so much to everyone  
But you count them up one by one  
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall  
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall  
Your black boots, my red flower ring  
They're for the little things, oho, yeah,  
  
No fighting, black riding, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile  
Pretending, defending, take a risk and go a thought for the right  
Strawberries and fairies with wings  
They're for the little things,  
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah  
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah.

You see me giving people weird looks, I can't help it is ma face,  
My kind is the odd and quiet type, but I can be loud when I want to,  
Don't be a racist idiot, you hate the nazis too,  
You're just a fat guy who needs a life, but I'm not helping that task  
You tell all your friends that I am real strange,  
You can't talk cos your gay,  
Fat gay, fat lad, fat man, hanging on the wall,  
You need give me space, ortherwise I will.... Nut you.  
  
Chorus  
You call me a phyco, you don't know what your saying,  
You call me every name under the starlit sky,  
Get a life, that's worth living, your making mine like hell.  
Don't be gay, oops wait, your bi-sexual,  
Don't be stupid and wreck your life,  
Go away dj, I aint that phyco, who nutted that lad under the old bridge,  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone!

title: Last Kiss

I still remember the look on your face  
Lit through the darkness at 1:58  
The words that you whispered for just us to know  
You told me you loved me so why did you go... away.  
  
I do recall now the smell of the rain,  
Fresh on the pavement,  
I ran off the plane,  
That July ninth, the beat of your heart,  
It jumps through your shirt I can still feel your arms.  
  
But now I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes,  
All that I know is I don't know,  
How to be something you miss.  
Never thought we'd have a last kiss  
Never imagined we'd end like this  
Your name forever the name on my lips  
  
I do remember the swing of your step  
The life of the party you're showing off again  
And I roll my eyes and then you pulled me in.  
I'm not much for dancing,  
But for you I did because  
I loved your handshake meeting my father  
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets  
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something.  
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions and  
  
I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes,  
All that I know is I don't know, how to be something you miss.  
Never thought we'd have a last kiss  
Never imagined we'd end like this  
Your name forever the name on my lips  
Ohh  
  
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep and  
I'll feel you forget me like I use to feel you breathe and  
I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are.  
Hope it's nice where you are and  
I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and  
Something reminds you,  
You wish you had stayed we can plan for a change in weather and time,  
I never planned on you changing your mind.  
  
So,  
I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes,  
All that I know is I don't know, how to be something you miss.  
Never thought we'd have a last kiss  
Never imagined we'd end like this  
Your name forever the name on my lips,  
Just like our last kiss,  
Forever the name on my lips,  
Forever the name on my lips.  
Just like our last

title: Last Christmas

[Chorus]  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
[Verse 1]  
Once bitten and twice shyed  
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye  
Tell me baby  
Do you recognize me  
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me  
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been  
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again  
  
[Chorus]  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
[Chorus]  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
[Verse 2]  
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes  
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice  
I thought you were someone to rely on  
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart  
Maybe this year  
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special  
  
Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
[Chorus]  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
And last Christmas  
And this year  
It won't be anything like, anything like  
  
[Chorus]  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special

(Low) If you're coming hello  
  
Kiss and tell, Kiss and tell  
I'm a different girl  
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell  
From a different world  
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell  
That's what I said  
Kiss and tell  
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell  
  
If I ain't holdin' you back  
You have your little panic attack  
I, I, I did it and it's O. M. G.  
I don't know what just happened to me  
  
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell  
I'm a different girl  
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell  
From a different world  
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell  
That's what I said  
Kiss and...

Kiss and tell, kiss and tell  
From a different world  
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell

Kiss and tell

title: Just South Of Knowing Why

She didn't have a reason to go, oh no  
She didn't have a reason to stay  
Either way she didn't tell anyone by the first ray of sun,  
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run  
And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,  
But I understand that somehow  
  
If I could drive all night  
Would I find my peace of mind  
Would it be a million miles of cold white lines  
And unfamiliar exit signs  
I'd just drive on by,  
Just south of knowing why  
  
I didn't really know her that well,  
But I could tell that her smile Was only something to hide behind.  
She felt so out of touch, Cause she just felt too much  
If you don't know what you want Nothings ever enough And time stands still,  
When you're nowhere bound,  
That's where I'm headed right now  
  
If I could drive all night  
Would I find my peace of mind  
Would it be a million miles of cold white lines  
And unfamiliar exit signs  
I'd just drive on by,  
Just south of knowing why  
  
I don't have a plan  
I don't have a map  
I don't even know if I'm ever going back  
And I don't have a when  
And I don't have a where  
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there  
  
But If I could drive all night  
Would I find my peace of mind  
Would it be a million miles of cold white lines  
And unfamiliar exit signs  
I'd just drive on by,  
  
I just drive on by  
Drive all  
Drive all  
Drive all night  
  
If I could drive all  
Drive all  
Drive all night  
Just south of knowing why

title: Jump Then Fall

I like the way you sound in the morning  
We're on the phone and without a warning  
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard  
I like the way I can't keep my focus  
I watch you talk, you didn't notice  
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together  
  
Every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you  
  
Woah-oh I'm feeling you baby  
Don't be afraid to jump then fall  
Jump then fall into me  
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
Cause I'm gonna stay through it all  
So jump then fall  
  
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face  
Oh, You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face  
Oh, I've never been so wrapped up, honey  
I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted  
I had time to think it over  
And all I can say is come closer  
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me  
  
Cause every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you  
  
Woah-oh I'm feeling you baby  
Don't be afraid to jump then fall  
Jump then fall into me  
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
Cause I'm gonna stay through it all  
So jump then fall  
  
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet  
I'll catch you, I'll catch you  
When people say things that bring you to your knees  
I'll catch you  
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry  
But I'll hold you though the night until you smile  
  
Woah-oh I need you baby  
Don't be afraid please jump then fall  
Jump then fall into me  
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
Cause I'm gonna stay through it all  
So jump then fall  
  
Jump the fall, baby  
Jump then fall into me  
Into me  
  
And every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine  
And every time you're here, baby I'll show you  
I'll show you you can jump then fall  
Jump then fall  
Jump then fall into me  
Into me  
Yeah

She can't see the way your eyes  
Light up when you smile  
She'll never notice how you stop and stare  
Whenever she walks by  
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her  
But you are everything to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I just wanna show you  
She don't even know you  
She's never gonna love you like I want to  
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me  
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable  
Instead I'm just invisible  
  
There's a fire inside of you  
That can't help but shine through  
She's never gonna see the light  
No matter what you do  
And all I think about is how to make you think of me  
And everything that we could be  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I just wanna show you  
She don't even know you  
She's never gonna love you like I want to  
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me  
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable  
Instead I'm just invisible  
  
Like shadows in a faded light  
Oh we're invisible  
I just wanna open your eyes  
And make you realize  
  
[Chorus:]  
I just wanna show you  
She don't even know you  
Baby let me love you let me want you  
You just see right through me

title: Innocent

I guess you really did it this time  
Left yourself in your war path  
Lost your balance on a tight rope  
Lost your mind trying to get it back  
  
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days  
Always a bigger bed to crawl into  
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything  
And everybody believed in you  
  
It's alright, just wait and see your string of lights are still bright to me  
Oh, who you are is not where you've been  
You're still an innocent, still an innocent  
  
Did some things you can't speak of  
But at night you'll live it all again  
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now  
If only you had seen what you know now then  
  
Wasn't it easy in your firefly catching days  
Everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you  
Wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep  
Before the monsters caught up to you  
  
It's alright just wait and see your string of lights are still bright to me  
Oh, who you are is not where you've been  
You're still an innocent  
  
It's okay, life is a tough crowd  
32 and still growing up now  
Who you are is not what you did  
You're still an innocent  
  
Time turns flames to embers  
You'll have new Septembers  
Every one of us has messed up too  
Minds change like the weather  
I hope you remember.  
Today is never too late to  
Be brand new  
  
Oh, it's alright just wait and see your string of lights are still bright to
me  
Oh, who you are is not where you've been  
You're still an innocent  
It's okay life is a tough crowd  
32 and still growing up now  
Who you are is not what you did  
You're still an innocent  
Still an innocent  
  
Lost your balance on a tight rope  
Oh, it's never too late to get it back.

I loved you for a little, a little while  
I think you know that!  
It would have worked for a little,  
Except for that day you...  
It's not like you to be here  
When you said you won't!  
  
Chorus:  
But in the pouring rain,  
You changed everything,  
You changed the tune!  
In the middle of the game,  
You changed everything,  
You changed the rules!  
It's not like we could forget something quickly,  
Except in the pouring rain.  
  
It kills me to say this,  
It really does, it kills my heart!  
But I might still love you,  
Reason we're just fallen apart.  
But it's not like e to answer  
Gonna change my mind!  
  
Chorus:  
But in the pouring rain, You changed everything,  
You changed the tune!  
In the middle of the game,  
You changed everything,

And it's not like we could forget something quickly,  
Except in the pouring rain.  
  
Oh, am I...  
All I torn myself I would be losing!  
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?  
My tears are falling down from the sky!  
In the pouring rain, I can feel...  
I wonder who you love tonight.  
Oh, in the pouring rain,  
In the pouring rain,  
Oh, in the pouring rain!  
In the pouring rain,  
You changed everything,  
You changed my mind!

title: I'm Only Me When I'm With You

Friday night beneath the stars,  
In a field behind your yard,  
You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.  
  
And sometimes we don't say a thing;  
Just listen to the crickets sing.  
Everything I need is right here by my side.  
  
And I know everything about you  
I don't wanna live without you.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm only up when your not down.  
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.  
It's like no matter what I do.  
Well you drive me crazy half the time;  
The other half I'm only trying to let  
You know that what I feel is true.  
And I'm only me when I'm with you.  
  
Just a small town boy and girl  
Livin' in a crazy world.  
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.  
  
And I don't try to hide my tears.  
My secrets or my deepest fears.  
Through it all nobody gets me like you do.  
  
And you know everything about me.  
You say that you can't live without me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm only up when you're not down.  
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.  
It's like no matter what I do.  
Well you drive me crazy half the time;  
The other half I'm only trying to let  
You know that what I feel is true.  
And I'm only me when I'm with you.  
  
When I'm with anybody else  
It's so hard to be myself.  
Only you can tell.  
  
[Chorus:]  
That I'm only up when you're not down.  
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.  
It's like no matter what I do.  
Well you drive me crazy half the time;  
The other half I'm only trying to let  
You know that what I feel is true.

title: If This Was A Movie

Last night I heard my own heart beating  
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs  
Six months gone and I'm still reaching  
Even though I know you're not there  
I was playing back a thousand memories baby  
Thinking bout everything we've been through  
Maybe I've been going back too much lately  
When time stood still and I had you  
  
Come back come back come back to me here like  
You would you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside till I came out  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You could you could if you just said you're sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now  
  
I know people change and these things happen  
But I remember how it was back then  
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing  
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them  
Now I'm pacing down the hall  
Chasing down your street  
Flashback to a night when you said to me  
That nothing's gonna change not for me and you  
Not before I knew how much I had to lose  
  
Come back come back come back to me here like  
You would you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside till I came out  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You could you could if you just said you're sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now  
  
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on  
I've be waiting for you ever since you've been gone  
I just want it back the way it was before  
And I just wanna see you back at my front door  
And I'd say  
  
Come back come back come back to me here like  
You would before you said it's not that easy  
Before the fight, before I left you out  
But I'd take it all back now  
  
Come back come back come back to me here like  
You would you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside till I came out  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You could you could if you just said you're sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now  
  
You'd be here by now  
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now  
Baby what about the ending  
Oh I thought you'd be here by now oh ohh ohh  
Woah oh oh  
That you'd be here by now

title: I'd Lie

I don't think that passenger seat  
Has ever looked this good to me  
He tells me about his night  
And I count the colors in his eyes  
  
He'll never fall in love  
He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair  
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong  
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind  
He tells a joke, I fake a smile  
But I know all his favorite songs  
  
And I could tell you  
His favorite color's green  
He likes to argue  
Born on the seventeenth  
His sister's beautiful  
He has his father's eyes  
And if you ask me if I love him...  
I'd lie  
  
He looks around the room  
And innocently overlooks the truth  
Shouldn't a light go on  
Doesn't he know  
That I've had him memorized for so long  
  
He sees everything in black and white  
Never let nobody see him cry  
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine  
  
I could tell you  
His favorite color's green  
He likes to argue  
Born on the seventeenth  
His sister's beautiful  
He has his father's eyes  
And if you ask me if I love him...  
I'd lie  
  
He stands there, then walks away  
My God, if I could only say  
I'm holding every breath for you  
  
He'd never tell you,  
But he can play guitar  
I think he can see through  
Everything but my heart  
First thought when I wake up,  
My God, he's beautiful  
So I put on my make-up  
And pray for a miracle  
  
Yes I could tell you  
His favorite color's green  
He likes to argue  
Oh, and it kills me  
His sister's beautiful  
He has his father's eyes  
And if you ask me if I love him...  
If you ask me if I love him...  
I'd lie

title: I Wished On A Plane

Throwing pennies at the fountain,  
When you're standing on a mountain,  
It's kinda hard to aim.  
  
But like the trees we cut our names in,  
There must be an explanation,  
Guess it didn't given off rain.  
I need reasons why you're leaving  
  
Chorus:  
Well I guess I wished on a plane,  
I thought it was a star,  
I guess what you wrote on a paper  
Wasn't really from your heart  
'Cause once you said you loved me  
I guess heard you wrong  
And I guess I wished on a plane  
And I thought it was a star.  
  
Driving off into the deepen,  
Honestly believe you'd be there,  
When I jumped in,  
Is an... Story,  
We had the perfect love story, is the ending.  
Nothing comes true, When it comes to youuu.  
  
Chorus:  
Well I guess I wished on a plane, I thought it was a star,  
I guess what you wrote on a paper  
Wasn't really from your heart  
'Cause once you said you loved me  
I guess heard you wrong  
And I guess I wished on a plane  
And I thought it was a star.  
  
And I was too cloudy,  
It's not my fault I just couldn't see.

It's 2 am, in your car  
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start  
You say it's in the past  
You drive straight ahead  
You're thinking that I hate you now  
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back  
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did  
I wish you knew that

We're a crooked love in a straight line down  
Makes you want to run and hide  
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back  
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did

And I wish you knew that  
I miss you too much to be mad any more  
And I wish you were right here, right now  
It's all good  
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons  
You give me everything and nothing  
This mad, mad, love makes you come running  
To stand back where you stood  
I wish you would, I wish you would  
I wish you would, I wish you would  
  
[Verse 3]  
2 am, here we are  
See your face, hear my voice in the dark  
We're a crooked love  
In a straight line down  
Makes you wanna run and hide  
But it made us right turn back around  
  
[Chorus x2]  
I wish you would come back  
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did  
I wish you knew that  
I will never forget you as long as I live  
And I wish you were right here, right now  
It's all good  
I wish you would

I wish we could go back  
And remember what we were fighting for  
I wish you knew that  
I miss you too much to be mad any more

[Verse:]  
You stand with your hand on my waistline  
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight  
I can hear them whisper as we pass by  
It's a bad sign (bad sign)  
  
Something happens when everybody finds out  
See the vultures circling dark clouds  
Love's a fragile little flame  
It could burn out, it could burn out  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes  
And guns  
They are the hunters, we are the foxes  
And we run  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby, I know places we won't be found  
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down  
Cause I, I know places we can hide  
I know places, I know places  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences  
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it  
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time  
Not this time  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it  
My love  
They are the hunters, we are the foxes  
And we run  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby, I know places we won't be found  
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down  
Cause I, I know places we can hide  
I know places, I know places

They are the hunters, we are the foxes  
And we run  
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it

And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down  
Cause I, I know places we can hide  
I know places, I know places  
  
[Outro:]  
They take their shots, we're bulletproof  
(I know places)  
And you know for me, it's always you  
(I know places)  
In the dead of night, you'll act so brave  
(I know places)  
And I know for you, it's always me

title: I Knew You Were Trouble

Once upon a time a few mistakes ago  
I was in your sights, you got me alone  
You found me  
You found me  
You found me-e-e-e-e  
  
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that  
And when I fell hard you took a step back  
Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e  
  
And he's long gone when he's next to me  
And I realize the blame is on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I've never been  
So you put me down, oh  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I've never been  
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground  
  
Oh, oh  
Trouble, trouble, trouble  
Oh, oh  
Trouble, trouble, trouble  
  
No apologies, he'll never see you cry  
Pretends he doesn't know, that he's the reason why  
You're drowning  
You're drowning  
You're drowning  
  
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street  
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be  
And now I see  
Now I see  
Now I see  
Eeee  
  
He was long gone when he met me  
And I realize the joke is on me, hey  
  
[Chorus]  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I've never beenSo you put me down, oh  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I've never been  
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground  
  
Oh, oh  
Trouble, trouble, trouble  
Oh, oh  
Trouble, trouble, trouble  
  
And the saddest fear comes creeping in  
That you never loved me  
Or her  
Or anyone  
Or anything  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I've never been  
Soyou put me down, oh  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I've never been  
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground  
  
Oh, oh  
Trouble, trouble, trouble  
Oh, oh  
Trouble, trouble, trouble  
  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
Trouble, trouble, trouble  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
Trouble, trouble, trouble

title: I Heart ?

Wish I had concentrated,  
They said love was complicated,  
But it's something I just fell into,  
  
And it was over-rated  
But just look what I've created  
I came out alive but I'm black and blue-ue  
  
Before you ask me if I'm alright,  
Think about what I,  
Had to do-oo, yeah  
  
Wake up and smell the break-up  
Fix my heart, put on my make-up  
Another mess I didn't plan,  
And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me,  
Wish you could only see,  
I've got an I heart question mark,  
Written on the back of my hand.  
  
I'd be fine if you just walked by,  
But you had to talk about why,  
You were wrong and I was right,  
  
But I can't believe you made me,  
Sit at home and cry like a baby,  
Wait right by the phone every night,  
  
And now you ask about you and I,  
There's no you and I,  
Remember what you put me through,  
I had to,  
  
Wake up and smell the break-up,  
Fix my heart put on my make-up,  
Another mess I didn't plan,  
And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me  
I wish you'd could only see  
I got an I heart question mark,  
Written on the back of my hand  
  
And when you're home alone at night,  
You'll still wonder  
Why you took everything I had, oh baby  
I had a lot about you and I,  
There's no you and I,  
And I know,  
Someday you will...  
  
Wake up and smell the break-up,  
Realize that we won't make-up  
It didn't go the way you planned,  
  
And you'll know you didn't beat me,  
When you look down and see,  
I've got an I heart question mark  
Written on the back of my hand,  
  
Written on the back of my hand  
An I heart question mark, yeah  
Written on the back of my hand

title: I Almost Do

I bet this time of night youre still up  
I bet youre tired from a long, hard week  
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window, looking out at the city  
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me  
  
And I just want to tell you  
It takes everything in me not to call you  
And I wish I could run to you  
And I hope you know that  
Everytime I dont,  
I almost do, I almost do  
  
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you  
Cause each time you reach out theres no reply  
I bet it never, ever occurred to you that I cant say hello to you  
And risk another goodbye  
  
And I just want to tell you  
It takes everything in me not to call you  
And I wish I could run to you  
And I hope you know that  
Everytime I dont,  
I almost do, I almost do  
  
We made quite a mess, babe  
Its probably better off this way  
And I confess, babe  
That in my dreams youre touching my face  
And asking me if I want to try again with you  
And I almost do  
  
And I just want to tell you  
It takes everything in me not to call you  
And I wish I could run to you  
And I hope you know that  
Everytime I dont,  
I almost do, I almost do  
  
I bet this time of night youre still up  
I bet youre tired from a long, hard week  
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window, looking out at the city

title: How You Get The Girl

[Verse:]  
Stand there like a ghost  
Shaking from the rain (rain)  
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"  
See it's been a long six months  
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want  
And that's how it works  
That's how you get the girl  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
And then you say, I want you for worse or for better  
I would wait forever and ever  
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together  
I would wait forever and ever  
  
[Chorus:]  
And that's how it works  
And how you get the girl, girl  
And that's how it works  
It's how you get the girl, girl  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Remind her how it used to be (be)  
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks  
Tell her how you must have lost your mind  
When you left her all alone and never told her why  
And that's how it works  
That's how you lost the girl  
And now you say...  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
And then you say, I want you for worse or for better  
I would wait forever and ever  
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together  
I would wait forever and ever  
  
[Chorus:]  
And that's how it works  
And how you get the girl, girl  
And that's how it works  
And how you get the girl, girl  
  
[Bridge:]  
And you know that I don't want you to go  
Remind me how it used to be  
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks  
And say you want me  
And the you say...  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
And then you say, I want you for worse or for better  
I would wait forever and ever  
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together  
I would wait forever and ever  
  
[Chorus:]  
And that's how it works  
And how you get the girl, girl  
And that's how it works

title: Hopelessly Devoted To You

Guess mine is not  
The first heart broken  
My eyes are not  
The first to cry  
I'm not  
The first to know  
There's just  
No gettin' over you  
Hello  
I'm just a fool  
Who's willing  
To sit around  
And wait for you  
But baby can't you see  
There's nothin' else  
For me to do  
I'm hopelessly  
Devoted to you  
  
But now  
There's nowhere to hide  
Since you  
Pushed my love aside  
I'm not in my head  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
  
My head is saying  
"Fool, forget him"  
My heart is saying  
"Don't let go"  
Hold on to the end  
That's what  
I intend to do  
I'm hopelessly  
Devoted to you  
But now  
There's nowhere to hide  
Since you  
Pushed my love aside  
I'm not in my head  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you

I think of you every single evening  
As I lay awake at night.  
I try to think; try to walk away with you... Me in  
And I say:  
  
Chorus:  
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,  
Say that everything will be fine!  
Oh, honey baby, oh,

When I say I wanna make you mine?  
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,  
Except you, honey baby!  
Oh!

As we walk down by the drives.  
Take my hand, take my breath away,  
Cause you make me feel like flying!

Except you, honey baby!  
Oh!  
  
Oh, you are everything I'll ever need  
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!  
Drive me crazy, have me baby,  
All I really wanna say is:  
  
Chorus:  
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,

title: Holy Ground

I was reminiscing just the other day  
While having coffee all alone  
And Lord, it took me away  
Back to a first glance feeling on New York time  
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme  
Took off faster than a green light, go  
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know  
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made  
And that was the first day  
  
And darling, it was good  
Never looking down  
And right there where we stood  
Was holy ground  
  
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress  
We had this big wide city all to ourselves  
We block the noise with the sound of I need you  
And for the first time I had something to lose  
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way  
And the story's got dust on every page  
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now  
And I see your face in every crowd  
  
'Cause darling, it was good  
Never looking down  
And right there where we stood  
Was holy ground  
  
Tonight Im gonna dance  
For all that we've been through  
But I don't want to dance  
If Im not dancing with you  
Tonight Im gonna dance  
Like you were in this room  
But I don't want to dance  
If Im not dancing with you  
  
Darling, it was good  
Never looking down  
And right there where we stood  
Was holy ground  
  
Tonight Im gonna dance  
For all that we've been through  
But I don't want to dance  
If Im not dancing with you  
Tonight Im gonna dance  
Like you were in this room  
But I don't want to dance  
If Im not dancing with you

Hey Stephen  
I know looks can be deceiving  
But I know I saw a light in you  
As we walked  
We were talking  
I didn't say  
Half the things I wanted to  
  
Of all the girls  
Tossing rocks at your window  
I'll be the one waiting there  
Even when it's cold  
Hey Stephen  
Boy you might have me believing  
I don't always have to be alone  
  
Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel  
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so  
Come feel this magic  
I been feelin' since I met you  
Can't help it if there's no one else  
Mmm I can help myself  
  
Hey Stephen  
I been holdin back this feelin'  
So I got some things to say to you, ha  
I've seen it all so I thought that I'd  
Never see nobody shine the way you do  
  
The way you walk  
Way you talk  
Way you say my name  
It's beautiful, wonderful  
Don't you ever change  
  
Hey Stephen  
Why are people always leavin  
I think you and I should stay the same  
  
Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel  
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so  
Come feel this magic  
I been feelin' since I met you  
Can't help it if there's no one else  
Mmm I can't help myself  
  
The dim in the street lights  
You're perfect for me  
Why aren't you here tonight?  
Waiting alone now  
So come on and come out  
And pull me near  
  
And shine, shine, shine  
  
Hey Stephen  
I could give you fifty reasons  
Why I should be the one you choose  
All those other girls  
Well they're beautiful but  
Would they write a song for you?  
  
Ha-ha!  
I can't help it if you look like an angel  
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so  
Come feel this magic  
I been feelin' since I met you  
Can't help it if there's no one else

But not this time

Here you come again  
Just when I've begun  
To get myself together  
You waltz right in the door  
Just like you've done before  
And wrap my heart  
'Round your little finger  
Here you come again  
Just when I'm about  
To make it work without you  
  
You look into my eyes  
And light those dreamy eyes  
And pretty soon I'm wonderin'  
How I came to doubt you  
All you gotta do  
Is smile that smile  
And there go all my defenses  
Just leave it up to you  
And in a little while  
You're messin' up my mind  
And fillin' up my senses  
  
Here you come again  
Lookin' better than a body  
Has a right to  
And shakin' me up so  
That all I really know  
Is here you come again  
  
All you gotta do  
Is smile that smile  
And there go all my defenses  
Just leave it up to you  
And in a little while  
You're messin' up my mind  
And fillin' up my senses  
  
Here you come again  
Lookin' better than a body

[Intro]You and I walk a fragile line  
I have known it all this time  
But I never thought I'd live to see it break  
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet  
And I can't trust anything now  
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ohh, I'm holding my breath  
Won't lose you again  
Something's made your eyes go cold  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Something's gone terribly wrong  
You're all I wanted  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Can't breathe whenever you gone  
Can't turn back now,  
I'm haunted  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Stood there and watched you walk away  
From everything we had  
But I still mean every word I said to you  
He will try to take away my pain  
And he just might make me smile  
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead  
  
Ohh, I'm holding my breath  
Won't see you again  
Something keeps me holding on to nothing  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Something's gone terribly wrong  
You're all I wanted  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Can't breathe whenever you gone  
Can't turn back now,  
I'm haunted  
  
I know, I know,  
I just know  
You're not gone. You can't be gone.  
No.  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Something's gone terribly wrong  
Won't finish what you started  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Can't breathe whenever you gone  
Can't go back,  
I'm haunted

And take for granted what you have.  
  
And it would be a fine proposition,  
If I was a stupid girl,  
And yeah I might go with it,  
If I hadn't once been just like her.  
  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that, oh oh  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
I see you turn off your phone,  
And now you've got me alone,  
And I say,  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that.  
  
Ohh, ohh ohh  
Ohh ohh ohh  
  
Call a cab,  
Lose my number,  
You're about to lose your girl,  
Call a cab,  
Lose my number,  
Let's consider this lesson learned.  
  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
Wanna see you pick up your phone,  
And tell her you're coming home,  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that.  
  
It would be a fine proposition,  
If I hadn't once been just like her.

title: Forever And Always

Once upon a time  
I believe it was a Tuesday  
When I caught your eye  
We caught onto something  
I hold onto the night  
You looked me in the eye  
And told me you loved me  
  
Were you just kidding?  
  
Cause it seems to me  
This thing is breaking down  
We almost never speak  
I don't feel welcome anymore  
Baby what happened  
Please tell me cause one second it was perfect  
Now you're halfway out the door  
  
And I stare, at the phone  
He still, hasn't called  
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all  
And you flashback to when he said  
Forever and always  
  
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
Cause I was there when you said  
Forever and always  
  
Was I out of line? Did I say something way to honest?  
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy?  
I looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute  
Now I'm not so sure  
  
So heres to everything  
Coming down to nothing  
Heres to silence  
That cuts me to the core  
Where is this going?  
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore  
  
And I stare, at the phone  
He still, hasn't called  
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all  
And you flashback to when he said  
Forever and always  
  
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
Cause I was there when you said  
Forever and always  
  
Didn't mean it baby?  
I don't think so  
  
Ohhhhh  
  
Back up, baby back up  
Did you forget everything?  
Back up, baby back up  
Did you forget everything?  
  
Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
Cause I was there when you said  
Forever and always  
  
Oh, I stare, at the phone  
He still, hasn't called  
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all  
And you flashback to when we said  
Forever and always  
  
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
Cause I was there when you said  
Forever and always  
  
You didn't mean it baby  
You said forever and always  
Yeah

title: Find Your Way Back Home On The Fourth Of July

We were both young when I first saw you. Cause baby your a firework come on  
Let your colors burst. Last Christmas I gave you my heart but the very next  
Day you gave it away. You change your mind like a girl changes clothes.Then
you can always find your way back home the fourth of July wherever I go.  
  
Chrous:The best of both worlds.  
  
Girls will always hold tight with a catperiller in the tree when they are
welcome back home after the day of forth July; they can't go to far away from
friends and family, but they can wish to be home again soon on the road again
after sun sets in the colurful skies on the fourth of july; with butterfly fly
away, butterfly fly away always witha beautiful copper wings across  
The skies tonight.  
  
These copper birds shall flap their copper glow wings while we girls makes are
dreams to come true; as we been waiting for, don't know how to find our way
back home on the fourth of july.  
  
The fourth of July will never fade away from us forever, we will always
remeber this day forever in our hearts when headed home on the road again
after the sun sets in the spotlight tonight.

title: Fifteen

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors  
It's the morning of your very first day  
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while  
Try and stay out of everybody's way  
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here  
For the next four years in this town  
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say  
You know I haven't seen you around, before  
  
(Chorus)  
'Cause when you're fifteen and  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen feeling like  
There's nothing to figure out  
But count to ten, take it in  
This is life before you know  
Who you're gonna be  
Fifteen  
  
You sit in a class next to a redheaded Abigail  
And soon enough you're best friends  
Laughing at the other girls  
Who think they're so cool  
We'll be out of here as soon as we can  
And then you're on you're very first date  
And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying  
And you're mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one  
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends  
When the night ends  
  
(Chorus)  
'Cause when you're fifteen and  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
When you're fifteen and your first kiss  
Makes you head spin 'round but  
In your life you'll do things greater  
Than dating the boy on the football team  
But I didn't know it at fifteen  
  
When all you wanted  
Was to be wanted  
Wish you could go back  
And tell yourself what you know now  
  
Back then I swore I was gonna  
Marry him someday  
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine  
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy  
Who changed his mind  
And we both cried  
  
(Chorus)  
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall  
I've found time can heal most anything  
And you just might find who you're supposed to be  
I didn't know who I was supposed to be  
At fifteen  
  
la la la la la...la la la la la...la la la la la  
  
Your very first day  
Take a deep breath girl  
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

Somethin' bout the way  
The street looks when it's just rained  
There's a glow off the pavement  
You walk me to the car  
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there  
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
We're drivin' down the road  
I wonder if you know  
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now  
But you're just so cool  
Run your hands through your hair  
Absent mindedly makin' me want you  
  
And I don't know how it gets better than this  
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless  
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance  
In a storm in my best dress, fearless  
  
So baby drive slow 'Til we run out of road  
In this one horse town I wanna stay right here  
In this passenger seat you put your eyes on me  
In this moment now capture it, remember it  
  
Cause I don't know how it gets better than this  
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless  
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance  
In a storm in my best dress, fearless  
  
Oh Oh  
  
Well you stood there with me in the doorway  
My hands shake I'm not usually this way but  
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave  
It's a first kiss, it's flawless, really something,  
It's fearless  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Cause I don't know how it gets better than this  
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless  
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance  
In a storm in my best dress, fearless  
  
Cause I don't know how it gets better than this

He said, "I got me a nice new apartment  
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?  
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."  
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,  
  
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow  
Won't you come back to me?  
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow  
In dark blue Tennessee  
  
He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.  
He's just hiding out on the other side of town  
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away  
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,  
  
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow  
  
Won't you come back to me?  
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow  
In dark blue Tennessee  
  
She almost called him on the night that he wrote  
These simple words on his goodbye note  
  
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow  
Won't you come back to me?  
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow

Daddy,  
I want you to know  
How my heart aches with your loss  
First your Father  
Now your Mother  
Life's most precious treasure  
"Parents"  
Though they are no longer  
With you on this earth  
They will forever  
Live in the hearts  
Of all who loved them  
  
I may not be right next to you  
To tell you how much "I love you"  
I may not be right next to you  
To give you a "Hug" of comfort Distance is a factor in our relationship  
But you are in my thoughts  
Everyday, from the moment I wake up  
You are in my thoughts  
You are in my heart  
And you are in my prayers  
  
I can never replace  
The loss of my beloved grandparents  
But as your Daughter  
I will always be here for you  
I am but a phone call away  
And if you close your eyes and think of me  
"Daddy I'm right beside you"

[Intro]  
I'd never gone with the wind  
Just let it flow  
Let it take me where it wants to go to  
You open the door  
There's so much more  
I've never seen it before  
I was trying to fly  
But I couldn't find wings  
But you came along and you changed everything  
  
[Chorus:]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier, crazier  
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier  
  
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own  
Every sky was your own kind of blue  
And I wanted to know how that would feel  
And you made it so real  
You showed me something that I couldn't see  
You opened my eyes  
And you made me believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Baby you showed me what living is for  
I don't wanna hide anymore  
Oh oh  
  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier, crazier  
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I could go back to every laugh  
But I don't want to go there anymore  
And I know all the steps  
Up to your door  
But I don't want to go there anymore  
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky, talk to the man with the reasons why  
And let me know what you find  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm to tired at night to call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
That you'll come in with the rain  
  
I could stand up  
And sing you a song  
But I don't want to have to go that far  
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart  
And you don't even know where I start  
Talk to your self, Talk to the tears, talk to the man who put you here  
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm to tired at night to call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
That you'll come in with the rain  
  
I've watched you so long, screamed your name  
I don't know what else I can say  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm to tired at night for all these games  
Just know I'm right here hoping

title: Come Back... Be Here

You said it in a simple way,  
4 am, the second day,  
How strange that I don't know you at all.  
Stumbled through the long goodbye,  
One last kiss, then catch your flight,  
Right when I was just about to fall  
  
I told myself don't get attached,  
But in my mind I play it back,  
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.  
I guess you're in New York today,  
I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.  
  
The delicate beginning rush,  
The feeling you can know so much,  
Without knowing anything at all.  
And now that I can put this down,  
If I had known what I'd known now,  
I never would have played so nonchalant.  
  
Taxi cabs and busy streets,  
That never bring you back to me,  
I can't help but wish you took me with you...  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.  
I guess you're in London today,  
I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.  
  
This is falling in love in the cruelest way,  
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.  
  
New York... Be here.  
But you're in London and I break down,  
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.  
  
This is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.  
I guess you're in New York today,  
And I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.  
  
I don't wanna miss you like this.  
Come back... Be here.  
Come back... Be here.

And when you take, you take the very best of me  
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something  
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day  
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say  
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through  
I've never been anywhere cold as you  
  
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray  
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away  
And you come away with a great little story  
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day  
So Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say

You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you  
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you  
  
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day  
Oh Every smile you fake is so condescending  
Counting all the scars you made

title: Closest To A Cowboy

I drive around this town  
In a Mustang with the top down  
And six running horses under my hood  
Well thats good enough for me  
Dont need the real thing  
Thats just another thing  
For me to try to tame  
Dont know if I could  
It might just break me  
I thought there for a little while  
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him  
  
Snap buttons on a denim shirt  
Blue jeans and a little dirt  
Thats the closest youll see me  
Feet hanging out a pickup truck  
Crazy and a little rough  
Running free  
Thats the closest to a cowboy  
Youll see me  
  
Before I met him  
I was so sane and grounded  
Before he taught me how to lie  
And crawl out the window  
I learned the dirt roads  
And I got my heart broken  
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry  
And how to let go  
I thought there for a little while  
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him  
  
Snap buttons on a denim shirt  
Blue jeans and a little dirt  
Thats the closest youll see me  
Feet hanging out a pickup truck  
Crazy and a little rough  
Running free  
Thats the closest to a cowboy  
Youll see me  
  
It was all a little  
Wonderful and strange  
But Ill never look  
At a sunset the same night  
  
Snap buttons on a denim shirt  
Blue jeans and a little dirt  
Thats the closest youll see me  
Feet hanging out a pickup truck  
Crazy and a little rough  
Running free  
Sitting fishing by the river bank  
Swimming in the water tank  
Thats the closest youll see me  
Feet hanging out a pickup truck  
Crazy and a little rough  
Running free  
Thats the closest to a cowboy  
Youll see me

title: Clean

[Verse:]  
The drought was the very worst  
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst  
It was months and months of back-and-forth  
You still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore  
Hum ahead as I lost the war  
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm  
  
[Chorus:]  
Rain came pouring down  
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe  
And by morning, gone was any trace of you  
And I think I am finally clean  
  
[Verse 2:]  
There was nothing left to do  
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room  
So I punched a hole in the roof  
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you  
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud  
But no one heard a thing  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Ten months sober, I must admit  
Just because you clean don't mean you don't miss it  
Ten months older, I won't give in  
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it  
The drought was the very worst  
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down  
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe  
And by morning, gone was any trace of you

Season's greetings, hope you're well  
Well I'm doing alright  
If you were wondering  
Lately I can never tell  
  
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time  
But there were Christmases when you were mine  
  
I've been doing fine without you, really  
Up until the nights got cold  
And everybody's here, except you, baby  
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold  
  
But for me it's just a lonely time  
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine  
  
Merry Christmas everybody  
That'll have to be something I just say this year  
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater  
And were your cousins late again  
When you were putting up the lights this year  
Did you notice one less pair of hands  
  
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time  
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight  
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing

Would you still wanna kiss without misletoe

Something holy, not superficial  
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives  
It's something we all try to ignore  
And put a wreath up on your door  
So here's something you should know that is for sure  
Christmas must be something more  
  
What if angels did not pay attention to  
All the things that we wished they would always do  
What if happiness came in a cardboard box  
Then I think there is something we all forgot  
What would happen if presents all went away  
Tell me what would you find  
  
You'd see that today holds something special  
Something holy, not superficial  
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives  
It's something we all try to ignore  
And put a wreath up on your door  
So here's something you should know that is for sure  
Christmas must be something more  
  
We get so caught up in all of it  
Business and relationships  
Hundred mile an hour lives  
And it's this time of year  
And everybody's here  
It seems the last thing on your mind  
  
Is that the day holds something special  
Something holy, not superficial  
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives  
It's something we all try to ignore  
And put a wreath up on your door  
But here's something you should know that is for sure

And it's a sad picture

You know it's all the same  
Another time and place  
Repeating history  
And you're getting sick of it

Raided and now cornered  
It's hard to fight  
When the fight ain't fair

Found things they never found

But we'll stand up, champions tonight  
It was the night things changed

The walls that they put up  
To hold us back  
Fell down  
It's a revolution  
Throw your hands up

I knew  
I wasn't gonna take  
This very well  
But I'd give everything  
To have you here today  
  
Everyday now  
They're talking war  
I know  
This time has been  
Like it's never  
Been before  
We're not talking  
About a week or two  
Oh, daddy  
Can I go with you?  
Oh, daddy  
Can I go with you?  
Oh, daddy  
Can I go with you?

title: By The Way

I had to catch my breath  
When I saw you there across the room  
Holdin her hand  
I'd have never guessed  
That starting over would look so good on you  
But here I am  
Still believing there might come a day  
We'll pick up where we left off  
  
And by the way  
Your eyes are dancing  
I'll say the chances of that  
Are getting slim  
And by the way  
My heart's still breaking  
It's going take it a while  
To love again  
So many things that I forgot to say  
By the way  
  
I should've let you know  
All the ways you made me feel alive  
I guess it's too late  
So I'll just get my coat  
And make my way into this breezy night  
Give you one last wave  
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing  
And come over here and say  
I'm looking good  
  
And by the way  
Your eyes are dancing  
I'll say the chances of that  
Are getting slim  
And by the way  
My heart's still breaking  
It's going take it a while  
To love again  
So many things that I forgot to say  
  
By the way  
You still look amazing  
And I must have been crazy  
To let you get away  
By the way  
If you ever wondered  
Still got the same old number  
Just in case  
I still miss you  
And I still love you  
By the way  
By the way, oh

Well, I saw the things you were doing at the vma's  
And when I got that video award, you took the mic away  
Now, I'll try to call security with every step I take  
And nothing will even stop with all the music that I ever make  
  
Don't think you're gonna win this time  
'Cause you better believe that you're not what you do  
I'll get ya! (yeah)  
I'll get ya! (yeah)  
And when I do, Kanye you'll be busted I don't wanna be mean to you  
But you better believe me when I tell you that  
You are never what you do  
You're busted. (Busted!)  
Yeah, everybody makes mistakes  
But, this is how it's gonna be until you apologize on the vmas  
You're busted!

title: Brought Up That Way

Emily comes home from school,  
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,  
He says "baby girl what's wrong with you?"  
She says "please don't make me go back there again"  
  
She said "I wish there was some way  
To make them stop it"  
So he drives down to  
That principle's ofice and says  
  
"I didn't bring her up  
So they could cut her down  
I didn't bring her here  
So they could shut her out  
I live my whole damn life  
To see that little girl's smile  
So why are tears pouring down  
That sweet face?  
She wasn't brought up that way"  
  
Emily's home late again  
He sees that boy drive away  
Oh, but something different this time,  
She doesn't have too much to say  
She said "he tried but  
There's just some things I won't do"  
And through the tears  
She said "I couldn't do that to you"  
And he said  
  
"I didn't bring you up so he could wear  
You down  
Take that innocent heart  
And turn it inside out  
I live my whole damn life  
To see my little girl's smile  
So don't let nobody take that away,  
You weren't brought up that way"  
  
The phone rings on a rainy night  
Says "it's Officer Tate"  
He said "sir, there's been an accident,  
You better come down here right away,  
A drunken driver missed an overpass,  
And Emily, she's fading fast"  
He says "God, I didn't bring her up  
To watch them lay her down  
Nearly killed me the day  
They put her  
Momma in the ground  
Only thing that kept me alive,  
Was that little girl's smile  
So please don't take that away,  
I won't be easy taking her today,  
She wasn't brought up that way"  
  
He stands over the hospital bed  
Emily opens her eyes

title: Breathless

Here you are now  
Fresh from your war  
Back from the edge of time  
And all that you were  
Stripped to the bone  
I thought you'd want to know  
  
That when you feel the world is crashing  
All around your feet  
Come running headlong into my arms  
Breathless  
I'll never judge you  
I can only love you  
Come now running headlong  
Into my arms  
Breathless  
  
Lay down your guns  
Too weak to run  
Nothing can harm you here  
Your precious heart  
Broken and scarred  
Somehow you made it through  
I only ask that you won't go again  
  
When you feel the world is crashing  
All around your feet  
Come running headlong into my arms  
Breathless  
I'll never judge you  
I can only love you  
Come now running headlong  
Into my arms  
Breathless  
  
I'm so glad to see you smiling  
So good to hear your laugh  
I think that you've found you even  
Missed yourself  
I'm only asking this because I think that  
Truth be told  
Oh, you'll never go again  
Again  
  
When you feel the world is crashing  
All around your feet  
Come running headlong into my arms  
Breathless  
I'll never judge you  
I can only love you  
Come now running headlong  
Into my arms  
Breathless

title: Breathe

I see your face in my mind as I drive away  
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way  
People are people  
And sometimes we change our minds  
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time  
  
Mmm mmm mmmmmm  
Mmm mmm mmm mmm  
  
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie  
It's the kind of ending you don't really want to see  
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down  
Now I don't know what to be without you around  
  
And we know it's never simple, never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand  
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to  
Breathe without you, but I have to  
  
Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt  
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve  
People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out  
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out  
  
And we know it's never simple, never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand  
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to  
Breathe without you, but I have to  
  
It's 2AM  
Feel like I just lost a friend  
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me  
It's 2AM  
Feel like I just lost a friend  
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me  
  
And we know it's never simple, never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
Oh  
I can't breathe without you, but I have to  
Breathe without you, but I have to  
Breathe without you, but I have to  
  
Ohh  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

title: Both Of Us

[Taylor Swift]  
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us  
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us  
  
[B. O. B]  
Ever thought about losing it?  
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip  
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you're due for rent  
And the grass so green on the other side.  
Make a n-gga wanna run staight through the fence  
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times, but still can't find no food in  
It,  
That's foolishness.  
  
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look,  
And the way we talk and the way we act, and the clothes we bought,  
How much that cost?  
Does it even really matter? Cause life is an uphill battle  
We all tryna climb with the same old ladder, in the same boat,  
With the same old paddle.  
  
Why so shallow? I'm just asking. What's the pattern for this madness?  
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick,  
Most of us ain't hollywood actors.  
But if it's all for one, and one for all,  
Then maybe one day, we all can ball.  
Do it one time for the underdogs,  
Sincerely yours, from one of yours.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us  
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us  
  
[B. O. B]  
I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle  
You just wanna live, been everythiing's so low that you could drown in a  
Puddle.  
That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up,  
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us.  
  
To every single time that they play this song,  
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us.  
When the tides get too high snd the sea upon your knees get so deep  
And you feel like you're just another person getting lost in the crowd,  
Where your partner, no please, uh, because we won't be near yet  
Both of us.  
  
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up  
And even though we always a chance to us  
These are the things that've molded us and if life hadn't chosen us  
Sometimes I wonder where woulda wind up  
Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint  
Feel better from the ground up, hey  
But if it's all for one, and one for all  
Then maybe one day, we all could ball  
Do it one time for the underdogs  
From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us  
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

title: Blank Space

[Verse:]  
Nice to meet you, where you been?  
I could show you incredible things  
Magic, madness, heaven, sin  
Saw you there and I thought  
Oh my God, look at that face  
You look like my next mistake  
Love's a game, wanna play?  
New money, suit & tie  
I can read you like a magazine  
Ain't it funny, rumors, fly  
And I know you heard about me  
So hey, let's be friends  
I'm dying to see how this one ends  
Grab your passport and my hand  
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
So it's gonna be forever  
Or it's gonna go down in flames  
You can tell me when it's over  
If the high was worth the pain  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
Cause you know I love the players  
And you love the game  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause we're young and we're reckless  
We'll take this way too far  
It'll leave you breathless  
Or with a nasty scar  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
But I've got a blank space baby  
And I'll write your name  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Cherry lips, crystal skies  
I could show you incredible things  
Stolen kisses, pretty lies  
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen  
Find out what you want  
Be that girl for a month  
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no  
Screaming, crying, perfect storms  
I can make all the tables turn  
Rose garden filled with thorns  
Keep you second guessing like  
"Oh my God, who is she?"  
I get drunk on jealousy  
But you'll come back each time you leave  
Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
So it's gonna be forever  
Or it's gonna go down in flames  
You can tell me when it's over  
If the high was worth the pain  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
Cause you know I love the players  
And you love the game  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause we're young and we're reckless  
We'll take this way too far  
It'll leave you breathless  
Or with a nasty scar  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
But I've got a blank space baby  
And I'll write your name  
  
[Bridge:]  
Boys only want love if it's torture  
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya  
  
[Bridge:]  
Boys only want love if it's torture  
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

title: Better Than Revenge

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did  
Ha, Time for a little revenge  
  
[Verse:]  
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer  
And, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him  
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause  
She took him faster than you could say sabotage  
I never saw it coming, more than I suspected it  
I underestimated just who I was dealing with  
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum  
She underestimated just who she was stealing from  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's not a saint and she's not what you think  
She's an actress, Whoa  
She's better known for the things that she does  
On the mattress, Whoa  
Soon she's gonna find  
Stealing other people's toys on the playground  
Won't make you many friends  
She should keep in mind,  
She should keep in mind  
There is nothing I do better than revenge, Ha  
  
[Verse]  
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list  
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it  
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling  
And, she thinks I'm psycho  
Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but  
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know  
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go  
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school  
So it's up to me  
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's not a saint and she's not what you think  
She's an actress, Whoa  
She's better known for the things that she does  
On the mattress, Whoa  
Soon she's gonna find  
Stealing other people's toys on the playground  
Won't make you many friends  
She should keep in mind,  
She should keep in mind  
There is nothing I do better than revenge, Ha ha  
  
[Bridge:]  
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey  
You might have him, but haven't you heard  
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey  
You might have him, but I always get the last word  
Whoa  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's not a saint and she's not what you think  
She's an actress, Whoa  
She's better known for the things that she does  
On the mattress, Whoa  
Soon she's gonna find  
Stealing other people's toys on the playground  
Won't make you many friends  
She should keep in mind,  
She should keep in mind  
There is nothing I do better than revenge,  
  
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,  
Cause I don't think you do, Oh  
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing  
I don't think you do, I don't think you do  
Let's hear the applause  
Come on show me how much better you are  
See you deserve some applause  
Cause you're so much better  
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

title: Being With My Baby

All is quiet in the world tonight  
Counting stars and fireflies  
When summer sings a lullaby  
For me and my baby  
  
On the hood of his Daddy's car  
We pass around his old guitar  
Bet Mama's wondering where we are  
It's just me and my baby  
  
The world is spinning round  
Look just what I've found  
  
Ooh, life's so sweet right here  
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy  
Ooh, just wanna stay right here  
Cause nothing's quite like  
Being with my baby  
  
Driving home by the riverside  
Wishing I could slow down time  
And take a picture of my mind  
Of me and my baby  
  
The car pulls up and I'm home too late  
We didn't take that interstate  
Those back roads were a better way  
For me and my baby  
  
The closer that we get  
I know I can't leave yet  
  
Ooh, life's so sweet right here  
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy  
Ooh, just wanna stay right here  
Cause nothing's quite like  
Being with my baby  
  
We both know what we've found  
So he turns that car around  
  
Ooh, life's so sweet right here  
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy  
Ooh, just wanna stay right here  
Cause nothing's quite like  
Being with my baby

Took a deep breath in the mirror.  
He didn't like it when I wore high heels but I do.  
Turn the lock and put my headphones on.  
He always said he didn't get this song but I do.  
I do.  
  
Walked in expecting you'd be late.  
But you got here early and you stand and wait.  
I walk to you.  
You pull my chair out and help me in.  
And you don't know how nice that is but I do.  
  
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.  
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause he never did.  
I've been spending the last 8 months thinking,  
All love ever does is break and burn and end.  
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again.  
  
You say you never met one girl who had as many James Taylor records as you  
But I do.  
We tell stories and you don't know why I'm coming off a little shy but I  
Do.  
  
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.  
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause he never did.  
I've been spending the last 8 months thinking,  
All love ever does is break and burn and end.  
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again.  
  
And we walk down the block to my car and I almost brought him up.  
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches. Every single
Christmas and I will talk about that for the first time.  
What's past is past.  
  
Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.  
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause he never did.  
I've been spending the last 8 months thinking,  
All love ever does is break and burn and end.  
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again.  
  
But on a Wednesday, in a cafe... I watched it begin again!

Yeah  
Woah  
  
Taylor:  
I know this isn't what I wanted  
I never thought it'd come this far  
Just thinkin' back to where we started  
And how we lost all that we are.  
  
Nick:  
We were young and times were easy  
But I could see it's not the same  
I'm standing here but you don't see me  
I'd give it all for that to change  
  
And I don't want to lose her  
Don't wanna let her go  
  
Taylor:  
I'm standing out in the rain  
I need to know if it's over  
Cause I will leave you alone

Flooded with all this pain  
Knowing that I'll never hold her  
Both:  
Like I did before the storm (yeah)  
Before the storm  
  
Nick:  
With every strike of lightning  
Taylor:  
Comes a memory that lasts  
Both:  
And not a word is left unspoken  
As the thunder starts to crash  
Taylor:  
Maybe I should give up.

I'm standing out in the rain  
I need to know if it's over  
Cause I will leave you alone

Flooded with all this pain  
Knowing that I'll never hold her  
Like I did before the storm  
  
Taylor:  
Trying to keep the lights from going out  
Both:  
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart  
We always say,  
A heart is not a whole  
Without the one who gets you through the storm  
  
Standin' out in the rain  
Knowing that it's really over  
Please don't leave me alone.  
I'm flooded with all this pain,  
Knowing that I'll never hold you  
Like I did before the storm  
  
Yeah  
Like I did before,  
The storm.

Did you have to ruin

Did you have to hit me  
Where I'm weak, baby I couldn't breath  
And rub it in so deep  
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me  
Oh it so sad to think about the good times  
You and I

Still got scars in my back from your knives

Now did you think it all through?  
All these things will catch up to you  
In time can heal but this won't  
So if you come in my way  
Just don't  
Oh it's so sad to think about the good times  
You and I  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause baby now we've got bad blood  
You know it used to be mad love  
So take a look what you've done  
Cause baby now we've got bad blood, hey!  
Now we've got problems  
And I don't think we can solve 'em  
You made a really deep cut  
And baby now we've got bad blood, hey!  
  
Band aids don't fix bullet holes  
You say sorry just for show  
If you live like that, you live with ghosts  
If you live like that you live with bad blood  
  
Band aids don't fix bullet holes  
You say sorry just for show  
If you live like that, you live with ghosts  
If you live like that you live with bad blood  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause baby now we've got bad blood  
You know it used to be mad love  
So take a look what you've done  
Cause baby now we've got bad blood, hey!  
Now we've got problems  
And I don't think we can solve 'em  
You made a really deep cut  
And baby now we've got bad blood, hey!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause baby now we've got bad blood  
You know it used to be mad love  
So take a look what you've done  
Cause baby now we've got bad blood, hey!  
Now we've got problems  
And I don't think we can solve 'em  
You made a really deep cut  
And baby now we've got bad blood, hey!

title: Back to December

I'm so glad you made time to see me  
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?  
I haven't seen them in a while  
You've been good, busier than ever  
We small talk, work and the weather  
Your guard is up, and I know why  
Because the last time you saw me  
Is still burned in the back of your mind  
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die  
  
[Chorus]  
So this is me swallowing my pride  
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night  
And I go back to December all the time  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine  
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright  
I go back to December all the time  
  
These days, I haven't been sleeping  
Staying up, playing back myself leaving  
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call  
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times  
I watched you laughing from the passenger side  
And realized I loved you in the fall  
And then the cold came, the dark days  
When fear crept into my mind  
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
So this is me swallowing my pride  
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night  
And I go back to December all the time  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine  
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind  
I go back to December all the time  
  
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile  
So good to me, so right  
And how you held me in your arms that September night  
The first time you ever saw me cry  
Maybe this is wishful thinking  
Probably mindless dreaming  
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right  
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't  
So if the chain is on your door, I understand  
  
This is me swallowing my pride  
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night  
And I go back to December  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine  
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright  
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind  
I go back to December all the time, all the time

title: Baby Don't Break My Heart Slow

I like the way you wanted me  
Every night for so long baby  
I like the way you needed me  
Every time things got rocky  
  
I was believing in you  
Was I mistaken do you mean  
Do you mean what you say  
When you say our love could last forever  
  
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie  
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby don't you break my heart slow  
  
I like the way you'd hold me  
Every night for so long baby  
I like the way you'd sing to me  
Every time things got rocky  
  
I was believing in you  
Was I mistaken do you say  
Do you say what you mean  
When you say our love could last forever  
  
Cause I'd rather you be mean than love and lie  
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby don't you break my heart slow  
  
You would run around and lead me on forever  
While I stay at home still thinking we're together  
I wanted our love to last forever  
  
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie  
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby don't you break my heart slow  
Baby don't you break my heart slow

title: American Girl

Well, she was an American girl  
Raised on promises  
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life  
Somewhere else  
  
After all it was a great big world  
With lots of places to run to  
And if she had to die trying  
She had one little promise she was gonna keep  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
Take it easy baby  
Make it last all night  
She was an American girl  
  
Well, it was kind of cold that night  
She stood alone on her balcony  
She could see the cars roll by  
Out on 441  
Like waves crashing on the beach  
  
And for one desperate moment there  
He crept back in her memory  
God, it's so painful  
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
Take it easy baby  
Make it last all night  
She was an American girl  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
Take it easy baby  
Make it last all night  
Oh yeah, all right  
Take it easy baby  
Oh, take it easy now  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
She was an American girl

title: American Boy

American boy, living life as it goes  
Sittin' on the fence posts  
Living in the lie  
American boy, living in the real world  
Trying just to get the girl  
Trying to survive  
  
Chorus:  
  
The simple things in life are always new  
Growing up on Sand Hill avenue  
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just  
The greatest living hero that ever was  
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy  
The hope of an american boy  
  
Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships  
Looking for the love  
Suddenly rise, an american beauty  
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above  
  
Chorus:  
  
The simple things in life are always new  
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue  
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just  
The greatest living hero that ever was  
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy  
The dream of an american boy  
  
American boy, raising little babies  
Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you  
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn  
That's grown up, american boy  
  
Chorus:  
  
The simple things in life are always new  
Growing up on Grandview avenue  
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just  
The greatest living hero that ever was  
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy  
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy  
The hope of an american boy

title: Am I Ready For Love?

Sometimes I wonder  
How it's gonna feel  
Will my first love be true and real  
Will I be ready when  
My heart starts to fall  
What will I do when my love comes to call  
  
And my daddy tells me  
That I light up his world  
Everyday he says "Darlin,  
You're my best girl"  
He tried to teach me  
From the very start  
The meaning of love  
So nobody breaks my heart  
  
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?  
Will it be filled with hope and desire?  
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?  
Am I ready for the joy?  
Am I ready for the pain?  
Am I ready for the boy?  
Am I ready for love?  
For love  
  
I know I'm not a little  
Girl anymore  
Cuz I'm feeling things  
I've never felt before  
Sweet sensations  
And anticipations  
Calling commotion  
To my emotions  
  
And I hear the words  
My daddy says to me  
He said "be true to yourself  
And keep your spirit free  
And love will find you One way or another  
Be good to yourself  
And be good to each other"  
  
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?  
Will it be filled with hope and desire?  
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?  
Am I ready for the joy?  
Am I ready for the pain?  
Am I ready for the boy?  
Am I ready for love?  
  
It's a run around the world  
And it's moving so fast  
Though I wanna find  
A love that's gonna last  
A love so strong  
That it can withstand  
The weight of the world  
In the palm of it's hand  
  
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?  
Will it be filled with hope and desire?  
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?  
Am I ready for the joy?  
Am I ready for the pain?  
Am I ready for the boy?  
Am I ready for this game?  
Am I ready for the kiss?  
Am I ready for the stars?  
Am I ready for the bliss?  
Am I ready for love?

title: All You Had To Do Was Stay

[Verse:]  
People like you always want back  
The love they gave away  
And people like me wanna believe you  
When you say you've changed  
The more I think about it now  
The less I know  
All I know is that you drove us  
Off the road  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
(Stay) hey  
All you had to do was stay  
Had me in the palm of your hands  
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?  
(Stay) hey  
Now you say you want it back  
Now that it's just too late  
Well could have been easy  
  
[Chorus:]  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was stay  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Here you are now calling me up  
But I don't know what to stay  
I've been picking up the pieces  
Off the mess you made  
People like you always want back  
The love they pushed aside  
But people like me are gone forever  
When you say goodbye  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
(Stay) hey  
All you had to do was stay  
Had me in the palm of your hands  
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?  
(Stay) hey  
Now you say you want it back  
Now that it's just too late  
Well could have been easy  
  
[Chorus:]  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was stay  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Let me remind you  
This was what you wanted  
You ended it  
You were all I wanted  
But not like this  
Not like this, not like this  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
(Stay) hey  
All you had to do was stay  
Had me in the palm of your hands  
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?  
(Stay) hey  
Now you say you want it back  
Now that it's just too late  
Well could have been easy

All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)

title: All Too Well

I walked through the door with you,  
The air was cold  
But something about it felt like home somehow  
And I left my scarf there, at your sister's house  
And you still got it in your drawer, even now.  
Oh, your sweet disposition  
And my wide-eyed gaze  
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.  
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  
And I can picture it after all these days.  
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more  
And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all...  
  
'Cause there we are again on that little town street,  
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.  
Wind in my hair, I was there  
I remember it all too well.  
  
Photo album on the counter,  
Your cheeks were turning red  
You used to be a little kid with glasses  
In a twin sized bed  
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team  
You taught me 'bout your past  
Thinking your future was me  
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do  
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...  
  
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night  
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
Down the stairs, I was there  
I remember it all too well  
  
Well, maybe we got lost in translation  
Maybe I asked for too much  
But, maybe this thing was a masterpiece  
'Till you tore it all up  
Running scared, I was there  
I remember it all too well  
And you call me up again  
Just to break me like a promise  
So casually cruel in the name of being honest  
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... Too well  
  
Time won't fly, it's like Im paralyzed by it  
I'd like to be my old self again  
But Im still trying to find it  
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week  
'Cause it reminds you of innocence  
And it smells like me  
You can't get rid of it  
'Cause you remember it all too well  
  
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so  
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well  
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all  
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well...

title: Ain't Nothin' About You

The way you look, the way you laugh,  
The way you love with all you have  
There ain't nothing about you  
That don't do something for me  
The way you kiss, the way you cry,  
The way you move when you walk by  
There's ain't nothing about you  
That don't do something for me  
  
Once I thought that love was something I could never do  
Never knew that I could feel this much  
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you  
Is more than a reaction to your touch  
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough  
  
The way you look, the way you laugh,  
The way you love with all you have  
There ain't nothing about you  
That don't do something for me  
The way you kiss, the way you cry,  
The way you move when you walk by  
There's ain't nothing about you  
That don't do something for me  
  
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh  
  
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows  
That never knocked me off my feet  
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go  
And baby it's no mystery  
Why I surrender  
Boy you got everything  
  
The way you look, the way you laugh,  
The way you love with all you have,  
There ain't nothing about you  
That don't do something for me  
The way you kiss, the way you cry,  
The way you move when you walk by  
There's ain't nothing about you  
That don't do something for me  
  
I love your attitude, All your tattoos,  
Your every thought  
Your smile, you lips  
And boy the list goes on and on and on  
  
The way you look, the way you laugh,  
The way you love with all you have,  
There's ain't nothing about you  
That don't do something for me  
  
The way you kiss, the way you cry,  
The way you move when you walk by  
There's ain't nothing 'bout you  
That don't do something for me  
  
The way you look, the way you laugh,  
The way you love with all you have,  
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive  
Right now I think you see  
There ain't nothin' about you  
That don't do something for me

title: A Place In This World

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me  
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out  
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking  
Trying to see through the rain coming down  
Even though I'm not the only one  
Who feels the way I do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know  
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on  
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in  
This world  
  
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans  
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve  
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine  
Could you tell me what more do I need  
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah  
But that's ok  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know  
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on  
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in  
This world  
  
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission  
But I'm ready to fly  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know, oh  
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on  
Oh, I'm alone on my own, and that's all I know  
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in  
This world  
  
Oh, I'm just a girl  
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh yeah

title: A Perfectly Good Heart

[Chorus 1:]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  
  
Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.  
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.  
No matter what you say, I still can't believe  
That you would walk away.  
It don't make sense to me, but:  
  
[Repeat Chorus 1:]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  
  
It's not unbroken anymore.  
How do I get it back the way it was before?  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?  
Why would you wanna break, why would you wanna break it  
  
[Repeat Chorus 1:]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
