title: Jump Then Fall

[Verse 1]  
I like the way you sound in the morning  
We're on the phone and without a warning  
I realize your laugh is the best sound  
I have ever heard  
  
I like the way I can't keep my focus  
I watch you talk, you didn't notice  
I hear the words but all I can think is  
We should be together  
Every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby  
Don't be afraid to  
Jump then fall  
Jump then fall into me  
Be there, never going to leave you  
Say that you want to be with me too  
So I'm a stay through it all  
So jump then fall  
  
[Verse 2]  
I like the way your hair falls in your face  
You got the keys to me  
I love each freckle on your face, oh  
I've never been so wrapped up, honey  
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted  
  
I had time to think it oh, over  
And all I can say is come closer  
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me  
Cause Every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
The bottom's going to drop out from under our feet  
I'll catch you, I'll catch you  
And people say things that bring you to your knees  
I'll catch you  
The time is going to come when you're so mad you could cry  
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa oh, I need you baby  
Don't be afraid, please  
Jump then fall  
Jump then fall into me  
Be there, never going to leave you  
Say that you want to be with me too  
So I'm a stay through it all  
So jump then fall  
Jump then fall baby  
Jump then fall into me, into me

And every time you shine, I shine  
And every time you're here  
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you

Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

title: Change

[Verse 1]  
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you  
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and  
You know it's all the same, another time and place  
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it  
But I believe in whatever you do  
And I'll do anything to see it through  
  
[Chorus]  
Because these things will change  
Can you feel it now?  
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down  
This revolution, the time will come  
For us to finally win  
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah  
Oh oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
So we've been outnumbered  
Raided and now cornered  
It's hard to fight when the fight arent fair  
We're getting stronger now  
Find things they never found  
They might be bigger  
But we're faster and never scared  
You can walk away, say we don't need this  
But there's something in your eyes  
Says we can beat this  
  
[Chorus]  
Because these things will change  
Can you feel it now?  
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down  
This revolution, the time will come  
For us to finally win  
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah  
Oh oh  
  
[Verse 3]  
Tonight we stand, get off our knees  
Fight for what we've worked for all these years  
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives  
But we'll stand up champions tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
It was the night things changed  
Can you see it now?  
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down  
It's a revolution, throw your hands up  
Cause we never gave in  
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah  
Hallelujah

title: The Best Day

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on  
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run  
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look now, the sky is gold  
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home  
  
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall  
But I know you're not scared of anything at all  
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away  
But I know I had the best day with you today  
  
I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean  
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys  
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away  
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names  
  
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school  
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you  
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay  
But I know I had the best day with you today  
  
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger  
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am  
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run  
And I had the best days with you  
  
There is a video I found from back when I was three  
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me  
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs  
And Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world  
  
And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall  
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong  
And I love you for giving me your eyes  
For staying back and watching me shine  
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say  
That I had the best day with you today

title: Forever & Always

[Verse 1]  
Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye  
And we caught onto something  
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me  
  
Were you just kidding?  
Because it seems to me, this thing is breaking down  
We almost never speak  
I don't feel welcome anymore  
Baby what happened, please tell me?  
  
Because one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door  
  
[Chorus]  
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called  
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to when he said forever and always  
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
Because I was there when you said forever and always  
  
[Verse 2]  
Was I out of line?  
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide  
Like a scared little boy  
I looked into your eyes  
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure  
  
So here's everything coming down to nothing  
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core  
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called  
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to when he said forever and always  
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
Because I was there when you said forever and always  
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so  
  
[Bridge]  
Back up, baby, back up  
Did you forget everything  
Back up, baby, back up  
Did you forget everything  
  
Because it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
Because I was there when you said forever and always  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called  
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to when we said forever and always  
  
[Chorus]  
And it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
Because I was there when you said forever and always  
You didn't mean it baby, you said forever and always, yeah

title: The Way I Loved You

[Verse 1]  
He is sensible and so incredible  
And all my single friends are jealous  
He says everything I need to hear and it's like  
I couldn't ask for anything better  
He opens up my door and I get into his car  
And he says you look beautiful tonight  
And I feel perfectly fine  
  
[Chorus]  
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name  
You're so in love that you act insane  
And that's the way I loved you  
Breaking down and coming undone  
It's a roller coaster kind of rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much  
And that's the way I loved you  
  
[Verse 2]  
He respects my space  
And never makes me wait  
And he calls exactly when he says he will  
He's close to my mother  
Talks business with my father  
He's charming and endearing  
And I'm comfortable  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
He can't see the smile I'm faking  
And my heart's not breaking  
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all  
And you were wild and crazy  
Just so frustrating intoxicating  
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name  
I'm so in love that I acted insane  
And that's the way I loved you  
Breaking down and coming undone  
It's a roller coaster kind of rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much  
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh  
  
[Outro]  
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh  
Never knew I could feel that much  
And that's the way I loved you

title: You're Not Sorry

[Verse 1]  
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around  
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down  
And it's taken me this long baby but I've figured you out  
And you're thinking we'll be fine again but not this time around  
  
[Hook]  
You don't have to call anymore  
I won't pick up the phone  
This is the last straw  
Don't wanna hurt anymore  
And you can tell me that you're sorry  
But I don't believe you baby like I did before  
You're not sorry (No no no no)  
  
[Verse 2]  
You're looking so innocent  
I might believe you if I didn't know  
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold  
And you've got your share of secrets  
And I'm tired of being last to know  
And now you're asking me to listen cause it's worked each time before but  
  
[Hook]  
You don't have to call anymore  
I won't pick up the phone  
This is the last straw  
Don't wanna hurt anymore  
And you can tell me that you're sorry  
But I don't believe you baby like I did before  
You're not sorry (No no no no)  
You're not sorry (No no no no)  
  
[Bridge]  
You had me crawling for you honey and it never would have gone away  
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade so  
  
[Hook]  
You don't have to call anymore  
I won't pick up the phone  
This is the last straw  
There's nothing left to beg for  
And you can tell me that you're sorry  
But I don't believe you baby like I did before  
You're not sorry (No no no no)  
You're not sorry (No no no no)  
(No fades out)

title: Tell Me Why

[Verse 1]  
I took a chance, I took a shot  
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not  
You took a swing, I took it hard  
And down here from the ground I see who you are  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sick and tired of your attitude  
I'm feeling like I don't know you  
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down  
And I need you like a heartbeat  
But you know you got a mean streak  
Makes me run for cover when you're around  
And here's to you and your temper  
Yes, I remember what you said last night  
And I know that you see what you're doing to me  
Tell me why  
  
[Verse 2]  
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day  
Well I get so confused and frustrated  
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sick and tired of your reasons  
I got no one to believe in  
You tell me that you want me, then push me around  
And I need you like a heartbeat  
But you know you got a mean streak  
Makes me run for cover when you're around  
Here's to you and your temper  
Yes, I remember what you said last night  
And I know that you see what you're doing to me  
Tell me why  
  
[Verse 3]  
Why do you have to make me feel small  
So you can feel whole inside  
Why do you have to put down my dreams  
So you're the only thing on my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sick and tired of your attitude  
I'm feeling like I don't know you  
You tell me that you want me then cut me down  
I'm sick and tired of your reasons  
I've got no one to believe in  
You ask me for my love then you push me around  
Here's to you and your temper  
Yes, I remember what you said last night  
And I know that you see what you're doing to me  
Tell me why  
Why, tell me why  
  
[Outro]  
I take a step back, let you go  
I told you I'm not bulletproof  
Now you know

title: Breathe

[Verse 1]  
I see your face in my mind as I drive away  
Because none of us thought it was  
Going to end that way  
People are people  
And sometimes we change our minds  
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time  
  
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm  
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm  
  
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie  
It's the kind of ending you  
Don't really want to see  
Because it's tragedy and it'll only bring you  
Down  
Now I don't know what to be without you around  
  
[Chorus]  
And we know it's never simple, never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to  
Save me  
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand  
And I can't  
Breathe  
Without you but I have to breathe  
Without you but I have to  
  
[Verse 2]  
Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt  
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve  
But people are people  
And sometimes it doesn't work out  
Nothing we say is going to save us from the fall out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
It's 2 A.M  
Feeling like I just lost a friend  
Hope you know it's not easy  
Easy for me  
It's 2 A.M  
Feeling like I just lost a friend  
Hope you know this arent easy  
Easy for me  
  
[Chorus]  
And we know it's never simple, never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't breathe  
Without you but I have to breathe  
Without you but I have to breathe  
Without you but I have to

Sorry, sorry  
Sorry, (Yeah eh) sorry  
Sorry, sorry

title: You Belong With Me

[Verse 1]  
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset  
She's going off about something that you said  
Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do  
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night  
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like  
And she'll never know your story like I do  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts  
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find  
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time  
  
[Chorus]  
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along, so why can't you see?  
You belong with me, you belong with me  
  
[Verse 2]  
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans  
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be  
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself  
Hey, isn't this easy?  
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town  
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down  
You say you're fine, I know you better than that  
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers  
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find  
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time  
  
[Chorus 2]  
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along, so why can't you see?  
You belong with me  
Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time how could you not know, baby?  
You belong with me, you belong with me  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh, I remember you driving to my house  
In the middle of the night  
I'm the one who makes you laugh  
When you know you're 'bout to cry  
And I know your favorite songs  
And you tell me 'bout your dreams  
Think I know where you belong  
Think I know it's with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
You belong with me  
Have you ever thought just maybe  
You belong with me?  
You belong with me

title: White Horse

[Verse 1]  
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel  
Comes out just when you need it to  
As I paced back and forth all this time  
Cause I honestly believed in you  
  
Holding on, the days drag on  
Stupid girl, I should have known  
I should have known  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not a princess, this arent a fairy tale  
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet  
Lead her up the stairwell  
  
[Verse 2]  
This isn't Hollywood, this is a small town  
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down  
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around  
  
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes  
And never really had a chance  
I had so many dreams about you and me  
Happy endings, now I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
This isn't Hollywood, this is a small town  
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down  
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around  
  
And there you are on your knees  
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me  
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry  
  
[Chorus]  
Because I'm not your princess, this arent a fairytale  
I'm going to find someone someday who might actually treat me well  
This is a big world that was a small town  
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now  
  
And it's too late for you and your white horse  
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Try and catch me now  
Oh, it's too late to catch me now

title: Hey Stephen

[Verse 1]  
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving  
But I know I saw a light in you  
And as we walked we were talking  
I didn't say half the things I wanted to  
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window  
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold  
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing  
I don't always have to be alone  
  
[Hook]  
Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel  
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so  
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you  
Can't help it if there's no one else  
Mmm, I can't help myself  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling  
So I got some things to say to you  
I've seen it all, so I thought  
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do  
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name  
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change  
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?  
I think you and I should stay the same  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me  
Why aren't you here tonight?  
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out  
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine  
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons  
Why I should be the one you choose  
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful  
But would they write a song for you?

Can't help myself

title: Love Story

[Verse 1]  
We were both young when I first saw you  
I close my eyes  
And the flashback starts  
I'm standing there  
On a balcony in summer air  
See the lights  
See the party, the ball gowns  
I see you make your way through the crowd  
And say hello, little did I know  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles  
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet  
And I was crying on the staircase  
Begging you please don't go, and I said  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
  
[Verse 2]  
So I sneak out to the garden to see you  
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew  
So close your eyes  
Escape this town for a little while  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter  
And my daddy said: "Stay away from Juliet"  
But you were everything to me  
I was begging you please don't go and I said  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel  
This love is difficult, but it's real  
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
  
Oh, oh  
  
[Bridge]  
I got tired of waiting  
Wondering if you were ever coming around  
My faith in you was fading  
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said  
  
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone  
I keep waiting for you but you never come  
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think  
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring  
  
[Chorus 3]  
And said: "Marry me Juliet  
You'll never have to be alone  
I love you and that's all I really know  
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress  
It's a love story baby just say yes"  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Because we were both young when I first saw you

title: Fifteen

[Verse 1]  
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors  
It's the morning of your very first day  
You say hi to your friends you haven't seen in a while  
Try and stay out of everybody's way  
  
It's your freshman year and you're going to be here  
For the next four years in this town  
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say  
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"  
  
[Chorus]  
Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you  
You're going to believe them  
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out  
Well, count to ten, take it in  
This is life before you know who you're going to be  
Fifteen  
  
[Verse 2]  
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail  
And soon enough you're best friends  
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool  
We'll be outta here as soon as we can  
  
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car  
And you're feeling like flying  
And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one  
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends  
When the night ends  
  
[Chorus]  
Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you  
You're going to believe them  
When you're fifteen and your first kiss  
Makes your head spin 'round  
But in your life you'll do things greater than  
Dating the boy on the football team  
But I didn't know it at fifteen  
  
[Verse 3]  
When all you wanted was to be wanted  
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now  
  
Back then I swore I was going to marry him someday  
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine  
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy  
Who changed his mind and we both cried  
  
[Chorus]  
Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you  
You're going to believe them  
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall  
I've found time can heal most anything  
And you just might find who you're supposed to be  
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen  
  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la

Your very first day  
Take a deep breath girl  
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

title: A Perfectly Good Heart

[Chorus]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  
  
[Verse]  
Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall  
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall  
No matter what you say, I still can't believe  
That you would walk away  
It don't make sense to me, but  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
It's not unbroken anymore  
How do I get it back the way it was before?  
  
[Chorus]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?  
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a

title: Superman

[Verse 1]  
Tall, dark and superman  
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away  
To save the world or go to work  
It's the same thing to me  
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition  
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him  
I hang on every word you say, yay  
And you smile and say, "How are you?  
I say, "Just fine"  
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you forever  
  
[Chorus]  
I watch superman fly away  
You've got a busy day today  
Go save the world, I'll be around  
I watch superman fly away  
Come back I'll be with you someday  
I'll be right here on the ground  
When you come back down  
  
[Verse 2]  
Tall, dark and beautiful  
He's complicated, he's irrational  
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah  
Something in his deep brown eyes has me saying  
He's not all bad like his reputation  
And I can't hear one single word they say  
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK  
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
And I watch you fly around the world  
And I hope you don't save some other girl  
Don't forget, don't forget about me  
I'm far away but I never let you go  
I'm love-struck and looking out the window  
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be  
Right here wishing the flowers were from you  
Wishing the card was from you  
Wishing the call was from you  
Cause I loved you from the very first day  
  
[Chorus]  
I watch superman fly away  
You've got a busy day today  
Go save the world, I'll be around  
Forever and ever here  
I watch superman fly away  
I swear I'll be with you someday  
I'll be right here on the ground  
When you come back down

La, la, la, la, la, la

title: Girl At Home

[Verse 1]  
Don't look at me  
You've got a girl at home  
And everybody knows that  
Everybody knows that  
Don't look at me  
You've got a girl at home  
And everybody knows that  
I don't even know her  
But I feel a responsibility  
To do what's upstanding and right  
It's kinda like a code, yeah  
And you've been getting closer and closer  
And crossing so many lines  
  
[Pre Chorus]  
And it would be a fine proposition  
If I was a stupid girl  
But honey I am no-one's exception  
This I have previously learned  
  
[Chorus]  
So don't look at me  
You've got a girl at home  
And everybody knows that  
Everybody knows that  
Don't look at me  
You've got a girl at home  
And everybody knows that  
Everybody knows that  
I see you turn off your phone  
And now you got me alone  
And I say  
Don't look at me  
You've got a girl at home  
And everybody knows that  
Everybody knows that  
  
[Verse 2]  
I just wanna make sure  
You understand perfectly  
You're the kind of man who makes me sad  
While she waits up  
You chase down the newest thing  
And take for granted what you have  
  
[Pre Chorus]  
And it would be a fine proposition  
If I was a stupid girl  
And yeah I might go with it  
If I hadn't once been just like her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
  
[Verse 3]  
Call a cab  
Lose my number  
You're about to lose your girl  
Call a cab  
Lose my number  
Let's consider this lesson learned  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
It would be a fine proposition  
If I hadn't once been just like her

title: I Wish You Would (Voice Memo)

This is another way I've written songs recently. This is a song I did with
Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so were hanging out and he
pulled out his phone and goes "I made this amazing track the other day. It's
so cool, I love these guitar sounds." And he played it for me and immediately
I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said "Please, please
let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me". And so he sent it to me
and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me
singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called "I Wish
You Would", because Jack wrote back and said "I love that". So this is another
way of writing, it's writing to track:  
  
_Okay so this is an idea called "I Wish You Would". It's kind of about this
guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he
passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but
she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like
this  
  
__It's 2 am, in your car  
Windows down, past my street the memories start  
It's in the past  
You drive straight ahead  
You thinking that I hate you now  
Cause you stll don't know what I never said  
  
I wish you would come back  
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did  
I wish you knew that_  
  
Do you like it!?

title: Blank Space (Voice Memo)

So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan
Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our
phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in
case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want
to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what
exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called "Blank Space,"
and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're
shouting out these production ideas like, you know the "Oh!" at the beginning
of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very
beginning stages of the song on the album called "Blank Space."  
  
"Nice to meet you, where you been?  
I could show you incredible things..."

title: I Know Places (Voice Memo)

So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song
writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you
write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with
lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and
that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is
shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and
how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe
that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together  
  
I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with
him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared.
I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the
studio just in case he wrote back and said "I can't stand that, I wanna work
on something else, think of something else". So I just sat down with the
piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him
where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we
ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record
called "I Know Places". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night
before we ended up finishing the song  
  
_"Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:  
  
Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i  
  
Na na na na waiting at the back door  
They're around and the vultures come around  
And you know that they won't, they won't us  
Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us  
And you come and sing and listen  
I would not think about it but I'm not done  
Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I  
  
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes  
And guns  
They are the hunters we are the foxes  
And we run  
  
Baby, I know places we won't be found  
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down  
Cause I, I know places we can hide  
I know places, I know places  
  
Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, no places_  
  
Or whatever I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark,
lyric like bridge thing and it's about like everyone is trying to get into and
ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the
chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus. So I hope you
like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing

title: New Romantics

[Verse 1]  
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything  
We wait for trains that just aren't coming  
We show off our different scarlet letters  
Trust me, mine is better  
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin  
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing  
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom  
Honey life is just a class room  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause baby I could build a castle  
Out of all the bricks they threw at me  
And everyday is like a battle  
But every night with us is like a dream  
Baby we're the new romantics  
Come along with me  
Heartbreak is the national anthem  
We sing it proudly  
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet  
Baby we're the new romantics  
The best people in life are free  
  
[Verse 2]  
We're all here the lights and boys are blinding  
We hang back its all in the timing  
It's poker, you can't see it in my face  
But I'm about to play my Ace  
We need love but all we want is danger  
We team up and switch sides like a record changer  
The rumors are terrible and cruel  
But honey most of them are true  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Breakdown]  
Please take my hand and  
Please take me dancing and  
Please leave me stranded  
It's so romantic, it's so romantic

title: You Are In Love

[Verse 1]  
One look, dark room meant just for you  
Time moved too fast, you play it back  
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke  
No proof not much  
But you saw enough  
Small talk, he drives  
Coffee at midnight  
Moonlight reflects the chain on your neck  
He says "Look up" and your shoulders brush  
No proof one touch, you felt enough  
  
[Chorus]  
You can hear it in the silence, silence you  
You feel it on the way home, way home you  
You can see it with the lights out, lights out  
You're in love  
True love  
You are in love  
  
[Verse 2]  
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday  
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word  
For once you let go of your fears and your ghosts  
One step, not much but it said enough  
You kiss on side walks, you fight, and you talk  
One night he wakes, strange look on his face  
Pauses, then says "You're my best friend."  
And you knew what it was, he is in love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Breakdown]  
And so it goes you two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round  
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown  
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars  
And why I spent my whole life trying to put it into words  
  
[Chorus x3]

title: Wonderland

[Verse 1]  
Flashing lights and we  
Took a wrong turn and we  
Fell down a rabbit hole  
You held on tight to me  
Cause nothing's as it seems and spinning out of control  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?  
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?  
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?  
Didn't it all seem new and exciting?  
I felt your arms twistin' round me  
I should have slept with one eye open at night  
  
[Chorus]  
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it  
And we pretended it could last forever  
We found Wonderland you  
And life was never worse but never better  
In Wonderland  
In Wonderland  
In Wonderland  
  
[Verse 2]  
So we went on our way, too in love to think straight  
All alone or so it seemed  
But there was strangers watching  
And whispers turned to talking  
And talking turned to screams, oh  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things  
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me  
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile  
Didn't it all feel new and exciting  
I felt your arms twisting round me  
Its all fun and games till somebody loses their mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Breakdown]  
I reached for you but you were gone  
I knew I had to go back home  
You searched the world for something else  
To make you feel like what we had  
And in the end, in Wonderland  
We both went mad  
  
[Chorus]

title: Clean

[Verse 1]  
The drought was the very worst  
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst  
It was months and months of back-and-forth  
You still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore  
Hung my head as I lost the war  
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm  
  
[Chorus]  
Rain came pouring down  
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe  
And by morning, gone was any trace of you  
And I think I am finally clean  
  
[Verse 2]  
There was nothing left to do  
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room  
So I punched a hole in the roof  
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you  
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud  
But no one heard a thing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Ten months sober, I must admit  
Just because you clean don't mean you don't miss it  
Ten months older, I won't give in  
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it  
The drought was the very worst  
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Something happens when everybody finds out  
See the vultures circling dark clouds  
Love's a fragile little flame  
It could burn out, it could burn out

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences  
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it  
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time  
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it

And I know for you, it's always me

title: This Love

[Verse 1]  
Clear blue water, high tides came and brought you in  
And I could go on and on, on and on  
And I will  
Skies grow darker, currents swept you out again  
And you are just gone and gone, gone and gone  
In silent screams and wildest dreams  
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad  
This love is alive back from the dead  
These hands had to let it go free  
And this love came back to me

Tossing, turning, struggle through the night with someone new  
And I could go on and on, on and on  
Lantern, burning, flickered in my mind for only you  
But you were still gone, gone, gone  
Been losing grip, sinking ships  
You showed up just in time

This love left a permanent mark  
This love is glowing in the dark  
These hands had to let it go free  
And this love came back to me

Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave  
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees  
When you're young you just run  
But you come back to what you need

Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Still got scars in my back from your knives

Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play  
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate  
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  
I shake it off, I shake it off  
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break  
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake  
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  
I shake it off, I shake it off  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightnin' on my feet  
And that's what they dont see, that's what they dont see  
I'm dancin' on my own, I'll make the moves up as I go  
And that's what they don't know, thats what they dont know  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
But I keep cruisin', can't stop, won't stop groovin'  
It's like I got this music in my mind sayin' it's gonna be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Post-Chorus] (x4)  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
  
[Interlude]  
Hey, hey, hey, just think while you've been getting down and out about the
liars and dirty, dirty cheats of the world you could have been getting down to
this sick beat  
  
[Bridge]  
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend  
She's like oh my God, but I'm just gonna shake it  
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair  
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake  
  
[Chorus]

title: All You Had To Do Was Stay

[Verse 1]  
People like you always want back  
The love they gave away  
And people like me wanna believe you  
When you say you've changed  
The more I think about it now  
The less I know  
All I know is that you drove us  
Off the road  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
(Stay) hey  
All you had to do was stay  
Had me in the palm of your hands  
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?  
(Stay) hey  
Now you say you want it back  
Now that it's just too late  
Well could have been easy  
  
[Chorus]  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was (stay)  
All you had to do was stay  
  
[Verse 2]  
Here you are now calling me up  
But I don't know what to say  
I've been picking up the pieces  
Of the mess you made  
People like you always want back  
The love they pushed aside  
But people like me are gone forever  
When you say goodbye  
  
[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Let me remind you  
This was what you wanted  
You ended it  
You were all I wanted  
But not like this  
Not like this, not like this

title: Out of the Woods

[Verse 1]  
Looking at it now  
It all seemed so simple  
We were lying on your couch  
I remember  
You took a Polaroid of us  
Then discovered (then discovered)  
The rest of the world is black and white  
But we were in screaming color  
And I remember thinkin'  
  
[Chorus] x2  
Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods yet?  
Are we out of the woods?  
Are we in the clear yet?  
Are we in the clear yet?  
Are we in the clear yet?  
In the clear yet? Good  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
(Are we out of the wo-o-ods?!)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Looking at it now  
Last December (last december)  
We were built to fall apart  
And fall back together (back together)  
Your necklace hanging from my neck  
The night we couldn't quite forget, when we decided  
We decided, to move the furniture so we could dance  
Baby like we stood a chance  
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying  
And I remember thinkin'  
  
[Chorus] (x2)  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?  
20 stitches in the hospital room  
And you started cryin', baby I did too  
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you  
Remember when we couldn't take the heat  
I walked out and said I'm settin' you free  
But the monsters turned out to be just trees  
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me  
You were lookin' at me  
You were lookin' at me, ooh  
I remember, oh I remember  
  
[Chorus] (x4)

title: Style

[Verse 1]  
Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights  
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise  
Fade into view, oh  
It's been a while since I have even heard from you  
I should just tell you to leave  
Cause I know exactly where it leads  
But I watch us go round and round each time  
  
[Chorus]  
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye  
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like  
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time  
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style  
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt  
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt  
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time  
We never go out of style, we never go out of style  
  
[Verse 2]  
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road  
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat  
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl, some
other girl"  
He says "What you've heard is true but I  
Can't stop thinking about you and I"  
I said "I've been there, too, a few times"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Take me home  
Just take me home  
Just take me home  
  
[Shortened Chorus]  
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye  
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like  
And when we go crashing down, we come back everytime  
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

title: Blank Space

[Verse 1]  
Nice to meet you, where you been?  
I could show you incredible things  
Magic, madness, heaven sin  
Saw you there and I thought  
Oh my God, look at that face  
You look like my next mistake  
Loves a game, want to play?  
New money, suit & tie  
I can read you like a magazine  
Ain't it funny, rumors fly  
And I know you heard about me  
So hey, let's be friends  
I'm dying to see how this one ends  
Grab your passport and my hand  
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend  
  
[Chorus]  
So it's gonna be forever  
Or it's gonna go down in flames  
You can tell me when it's over  
If the high was worth the pain  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
Cause you know I love the players  
And you love the game  
Cause we're young and we're reckless  
We'll take this way too far  
It'll leave you breathless  
Or with a nasty scar  
Got a long list of ex-lovers  
They'll tell you I'm insane  
But I've got a blank space, baby  
And I'll write your name  
  
[Verse 2]  
Cherry lips, crystal skies  
I could show you incredible things  
Stolen kisses, pretty lies  
You're the King baby I'm your Queen  
Find out what you want  
Be that girl for a month  
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no  
Screaming, crying, perfect storm  
I can make all the tables turn  
Rose gardens filled with thorns  
Keep you second guessing like  
"Oh my God, who is she?"  
I get drunk on jealousy  
But you'll come back each time you leave  
Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge] (x2)  
Boys only want love if it's torture  
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

title: Welcome to New York

[Verse 1]  
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow  
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats  
Everybody here wanted something more  
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before  
And it said  
  
[Chorus]  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
It's a new soundtrack  
I can dance to this beat (beat)  
Forevermore  
The lights are so bright  
But they never blind me (me)  
Welcome to New York!  
It's been waiting for you  
Welcome to New York  
Welcome to New York  
  
[Verse 2]  
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors  
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer  
Everybody here was someone else before  
And you can want who you want  
Boys and boys and girls and girls  
  
[Chorus + Post-Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing  
Like any real love, it's ever-changing  
Like any true love, it drives you crazy  
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

title: Come Back... Be Here

[Verse 1]  
You said it in a simple way  
4 AM, the second day  
How strange that I don't know you at all  
Stumbled through the long goodbye  
One last kiss, then catch your flight  
Right when I was just about to fall  
  
I told myself don't get attached  
But in my mind I play it back  
Spinning faster than the plane that took you  
  
[Chorus]  
And this is when the feeling sinks in  
I don't wanna miss you like this  
Come back be here, come back be here  
I guess you're in New York today  
I don't wanna need you this way  
Come back be here, come back be here  
  
[Verse 2]  
The delicate beginning rush  
The feeling you can know so much  
Without knowing anything at all  
And now that I can put this down  
If I had known what I'd known now  
I never would have played so nonchalant  
  
Taxi cabs and busy streets  
That never bring you back to me  
I can't help but wish you took me with you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
And this is when the feeling sinks in  
I don't wanna miss you like this  
Come back be here, come back be here  
I guess you're in London today  
I don't wanna need you this way  
Come back be here, come back be here  
  
[Verse 3]  
This is falling in love in the cruelest way  
This is falling for you and you are worlds away  
  
New York be here  
But you're in London and I break down  
Cause it's not fair that you're not around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
I don't wanna miss you like this  
Come back be here  
Come back be here

title: The Moment I Knew

[Verse 1]  
You should've been there  
Should've burst through the door  
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile  
And it would've felt like  
A million little shining stars had just aligned  
And I would've been so happy  
  
[Pre hook]  
Christmas lights glisten  
I've got my eye on the door  
Just waiting for you to walk in  
But the time is ticking  
People ask me how I've been  
As I comb back through my memory  
How you said you'd be here  
You said you'd be here  
  
[Hook]  
And it was like slow motion  
Standing there in my party dress  
In red lipstick  
With no one to impress  
And they're all laughing  
As I'm looking around the room  
But there's one thing missing  
And that was the moment I knew  
  
[Verse 2]  
And the hours pass by  
Now I just wanna be alone  
But your close friends always seem to know  
When there's something really wrong  
So they follow me down the hall  
And there in the bathroom  
I try not to fall apart  
And the sinking feeling starts  
As I say hopelessly  
"He said he'd be here"  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
What do you say  
When tears are streaming down your face  
In front of everyone you know?  
And what do you do when the one  
Who means the most to you  
Is the one who didn't show?  
You should've been here  
And I would've been so happy  
  
[Hook]  
  
  
[Outro]  
You call me later  
And say, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it"  
And I say, "I'm sorry too"  
And that was the moment I knew

title: Begin Again

[Verse 1]  
Took a deep breath in the mirror  
He didn't like it when I wore high heels  
But I do  
Turn the lock and put my headphones on  
He always said he didn't get this song  
But I do, I do  
  
Walked in expecting you'd be late  
But you got here early and you stand and wave  
I walk to you  
You pull my chair out and help me in  
And you don't know how nice that is  
But I do  
  
[Chorus]  
And you throw your head back laughing  
Like a little kid  
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause  
He never did  
I've been spending the last 8 months  
Thinking all love ever does  
Is break and burn and end  
But on a Wednesday in a cafe  
I watched it begin again  
  
[Verse 2]  
You said you never met one girl who  
Had as many James Taylor records as you  
But I do  
We tell stories and you don't know why  
I'm coming off a little shy  
But I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
And we walked down the block, to my car  
And I almost brought him up  
But you start to talk about the movies  
That your family watches every single Christmas  
And I want to talk about that  
And for the first time  
What's past is past

[Hook]  
I said oh my, what a marvellous tune  
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved  
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing, dancing  
Like we're made of starlight  
Like we're made of starlight  
  
[Verse 1]  
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45  
Picked me up, late one night at the window  
He was 17 and crazy, running wild, wild  
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in  
The night we snuck into a yacht club party  
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 2]  
He said look at you worrying so much about things you can't change  
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way  
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me  
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?  
Don't you dream impossible things?  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Bridge]  
Ooh ooh he's talking crazy  
Ooh ooh dancing with me  
Ooh ooh we could get married  
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream  
  
[Hook 2]  
Oh my, what a marvellous tune  
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved  
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing, dancing  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we dream impossible dreams  
Like starlight, starlight  
Like we dream impossible dreams  
Don't you see the starlight starlight

All I knew this morning when I woke  
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before  
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago is green eyes and freckles and your smile  
In the back of my mind making me feel like

You better know you better now

Cause all I know is we said hello  
And your eyes look like coming home  
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed  
All I know is you held the door  
You'll be mine and I'll be yours  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed  
  
[Verse 2: Both]  
And all my walls stood tall painted blue  
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you  
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies the beautiful kind  
Making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like

All I know is we said hello  
So dust off your highest hopes

And everything has changed  
All I know is a new found grace  
All my days, i'll know your face  
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Verse 1]  
New to town with a made up name  
In the angel city, chasing fortune and fame  
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream  
You had it figured out since you were in school  
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool  
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky  
  
[Hook]  
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one  
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one  
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now its big black cars, and Riviera views  
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you  
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page  
And they tell you that youre lucky  
But youre so confused  
Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used  
And all the young things line up to take your place  
  
[Bridge 2]  
Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if youll make it out alive  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
It was a few years later, I showed up here  
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared  
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out  
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere  
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square  
And it took some time, but I understand it now  
  
[Bridge 3]  
Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one  
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one  
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one  
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]  
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket  
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late  
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket  
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait  
  
[Hook]  
We had a beautiful magic love there  
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair  
  
[Verse 2]  
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation  
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities  
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you  
And you've got your demons and darling they all look like me  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Bridge]  
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting  
Silence, the train runs off its tracks  
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?  
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

title: Holy Ground

[Verse 1]  
I was reminiscing just the other day  
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away  
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time  
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme  
Took off faster than a green light, go  
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know  
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made  
And that was the first day  
  
[Hook]  
And darling, it was good never looking down  
And right there where we stood was holy ground  
  
[Verse 2]  
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress  
We had this big wide city all to ourselves  
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'  
And for the first time I had something to lose  
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way  
And the story's got dust on every page  
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now  
And I see your face in every crowd  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Bridge]  
Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through  
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

Just for you to go again  
Disappear when you come back  
Everything is better

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night  
I threw my phone across the room at you  
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed  
This morning I said we should talk about it  
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved  
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet  
And said okay let's talk  
And I said  
  
[Hook]  
Stay stay stay I've been loving you for quite some time time time  
You think that it's funny when I'm mad mad mad  
But I think that it's best if we both stay  
  
[Verse 2]  
Before you I only dated self indulgent takers  
Who took all of their problems out on me  
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing  
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

You took the time to memorize me my fears my hopes and dreams  
I just like hanging out with you all the time

title: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together

[Verse 1]  
I remember when we broke up, the first time  
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," cause like  
We hadn't seen each other in a month  
When you said you needed space. What?  
Then you come around again and say  
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change; trust me"  
Remember how that lasted for a day?  
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"  
  
Ooh we called it off again last night  
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you  
  
[Chorus]  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
We are never ever ever getting back together  
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me  
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together  
  
Like ever  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me  
Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you  
Would hide away and find your piece of mind  
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine  
  
Ooh, you called me up again tonight  
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh!  
  
[Bridge]  
I used to think that we were forever ever  
And I used to say, "Never say never"  
Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"  
And I'm like, "I just, I mean this is exhausting, you know  
Like, we are never getting back together, like ever"  
  
[Chorus] x2

title: I Almost Do

[Verse 1]  
I bet this time of night youre still up  
I bet youre tired from a long, hard week  
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window, looking out at the city  
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me  
  
[Chorus]  
And I just want to tell you  
It takes everything in me not to call you  
And I wish I could run to you  
And I hope you know that  
Everytime I dont  
I almost do, I almost do  
  
[Verse 2]  
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you  
Cause each time you reach out theres no reply  
I bet it never, ever occurred to you that I cant say hello to you  
And risk another goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
We made quite a mess, babe  
Its probably better off this way  
And I confess, babe  
That in my dreams youre touching my face  
And asking me if I want to try again with you  
And I almost do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
I bet this time of night youre still up  
I bet youre tired from a long, hard week  
I bet youre sittin' in your chair by the window, looking out at the city  
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me

title: 22

[Verse 1]  
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters  
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh  
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight  
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
Yeah  
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time  
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah  
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines  
It's time, uh uh  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty two  
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you  
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to  
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22  
22  
  
[Verse 2]  
It seems like one of those nights  
This place is too crowded, too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh  
(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)  
It seems like one of those nights  
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming  
Instead of sleeping  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Yeah  
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way  
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah  
Tonight's the night when we forget about  
The heartbreaks, it's time  
Oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Interlude]  
I don't know about you  
22, 22  
  
[Bridge]  
It feels like one of those nights  
We ditch the whole scene  
It feels like one of those nights  
We won't be sleeping  
It feels like one of those nights  
You look like bad news, I gotta have you  
I gotta have you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Interlude 2]  
Dancing like 22, yeah, 22, yeah yeah  
  
[Outro]  
It feels like one of those nights  
We ditch the whole scene  
It feels like one of those nights  
We won't be sleeping  
It feels like one of those nights  
You look like bad news, I gotta have you  
I gotta have you

title: All  Too Well

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold  
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I  
Left my scarf there at your sister's house  
And you've still got it in your drawer even now  
  
Oh, your sweet disposition  
And my wide-eyed gaze  
We're singing in a car getting lost Upstate  
The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  
And I can picture it after all these days  
  
And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more  
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all  
  
Cause there we are again on that little town street  
You almost ran the red cause you were looking' over at me  
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
Photo album on the counter  
Your cheeks were turning red  
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed  
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team  
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me  
  
And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do  
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to  
  
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night  
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah  
  
Maybe we got lost in translation  
Maybe I asked for too much  
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece  
'Till you tore it all up  
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
So casually cruel in the name of being honest  
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well  
  
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it  
Id like to be my old self again  
But I'm still trying to find it  
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week  
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  
You can't get rid of it, cause you remember it all too well  
  
Because there we are again when I loved you so  
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all  
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

title: I Knew You Were Trouble

[Produced by Max Martin and Shellback]  
  
[Verse 1]  
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago  
I was in your sights, you got me all alone  
You found me  
You found me  
You found me  
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that  
And when I fell hard, you took a step back  
Without me  
Without me  
Without me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And he's long gone, when he's next to me  
And I realize the blame is on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I'd never been  
Till you put me down  
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I'd never been  
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground  
Oh, Oh  
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble  
Oh, Oh  
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble  
  
[Verse 2]  
No apologies, he'll never see you cry  
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why  
You're drowning  
You're drowning  
You're drowning  
Now I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street  
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be  
And now I see  
Now I see  
Now I see  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
He was long gone when he met me  
And I realize the joke is on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
And the saddest fear, comes creeping in  
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

title: Treacherous

[Produced by Dan Wilson]  
  
[Verse 1]  
Put your lips close to mine  
As long as they don't touch  
Out of focus, eye  
To eye  
Till the gravity's too much  
And ill do anything you say  
If you say it with your hands  
And i'd be smart to walk away  
But you're quick sand  
  
[Hook]  
This slope is Treacherous  
This path is reckless  
This slope is Treacherous  
And I I I like it  
  
[Verse 2]  
I can't decide if it's a choice  
Getting swept away  
I hear the sound of my own voice  
Asking you to stay  
And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along  
Forever going with the flow but you're friction  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Bridge]  
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night  
And I will get you get you alone  
Your name has echoed through my mind  
And I just think you should think you should know  
That nothing safe is worth the drive  
And I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home

title: Red

[Produced by Dann Huff, Nathan Chapman, and Taylor Swift]  
  
[Verse 1]  
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati  
Down a dead-end street  
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin  
Ending so suddenly  
Loving him is like trying to change your mind  
Once you're already flying through the free fall  
Like the colors in autumn, so bright  
Just before they lose it all  
  
[Chorus]  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark grey, all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
But loving him was red  
  
[Verse 2]  
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted  
Was right there in front of you  
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing  
All the words to your old favorite song  
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword  
And realizing there's no right answer  
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out  
That love could be that strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes  
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go  
But moving on from him is impossible  
When I still see it all in my head  
In burning red  
Loving him was red  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head  
Comes back to me, burning red  
Yeah, yeah  
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

title: State of Grace

[Produced by Nathan Chapman]  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights  
Busy streets and busy lives  
And all we know is touch and go  
We are alone with our changing minds  
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I never saw you coming  
And Ill never be the same  
  
[Verse 2]  
You come around and the armor falls  
Pierce the room like a cannon ball  
Now all we know, is dont let go  
We are alone just you and me  
Up in your room and our slates are clean  
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes  
  
So you were never a saint  
And I've love in shades of wrong  
We learn to live with the pain  
Mosaic broken hearts  
But this love is brave and wild  
  
[Chorus]  
And I never saw you coming  
And Ill never be the same  
This is a state of grace  
This is the worthwhile fight  
Love is a ruthless game  
Unless you play it good and right  
These are the hands of fate  
Youre my Achilles heel  
This is the golden age of something good  
And right and real  
  
[Bridge]  
And I never saw you coming  
And Ill never be the same  
And I never saw you coming  
And Ill never be the same  
This is a state of grace  
This is a worthwhile fight  
Love is a ruthless game  
Unless you play it good and right

title: If This Was A Movie

[Verse 1]  
Last night I heard my own heart beating  
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs  
Six months gone and I'm still reaching  
Even though I know you're not there  
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby  
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through  
Maybe I've been going back too much lately  
When time stood still and I had you  
  
[Chorus]  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You would, you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now  
  
[Verse 2]  
I know people change and these things happen  
But I remember how it was back then  
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing  
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them  
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street  
Flashback to the night when you said to me  
"Nothing's going to change, not for me and you  
Not before I knew how much I had to lose"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
If you're out there  
If you're somewhere  
If you're moving on  
I've been waiting for you  
Ever since you've been gone  
I just want it back the way it was before  
And I just want to see you back at my front door  
And I say  
  
[Chorus]  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You would before you said it's not that easy  
Before the fight, before I locked you out  
But I take it all back now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 4]  
You'd be here by now  
It's not the kind of ending you want to see now  
Baby, what about the ending  
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa  
Thought you'd be here by now

title: Ours

[Verse 1]  
Elevator buttons and morning air  
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs  
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares  
But right now my time is theirs  
  
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves  
They'll judge it like they know about me and you  
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do  
The jury's out, but my choice is you  
  
[Chorus]  
So don't you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
And life makes love look hard  
The stakes are high, the water's rough  
But this love is ours  
  
[Verse 2]  
You never know what people have up their sleeves  
Ghosts from your past going to jump out at me  
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles  
But I don't care cause right now you're mine  
  
[Chorus]  
And you'll say  
Don't you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
And life makes love look hard  
The stakes are high, the water's rough  
But this love is ours  
  
[Verse 3]  
And it's not theirs to speculate  
If it's wrong and  
Your hands are tough  
But they are where mine belong and  
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith  
With this song for you  
  
Cause I love the gap between your teeth  
And I love the riddles that you speak  
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored  
Cause my heart is yours  
  
[Chorus]  
So don't you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
And life makes love look hard  
Don't you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
But they can't take what's ours  
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough  
But this love is ours

title: Long Live

[Verse 1]  
I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind  
The time we stood with our shaking hands  
The crowds in the stands went wild  
We were the Kings and the Queens  
And they read off our names  
The night you danced like you knew our lives  
Would never be the same  
You held your head like a hero  
On a history book page  
It was the end of a decade  
But the start of an age  
  
[Chorus]  
Long live the walls we crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
I was screaming long live all the magic we made  
And bring on all the pretenders  
One day, we will be remembered  
  
[Verse 2]  
I said remember this feeling  
I passed the pictures around  
Of all the years that we stood there  
On the side-lines wishing for right now  
We are the Kings and the Queens  
You traded your baseball cap for a crown  
When they gave us our trophies  
And we held them up for our town  
And the cynics were outraged  
Screaming "this is absurd"  
Cause for a moment a band of thieves  
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world  
  
[Chorus]  
Long live the walls we crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
I was screaming long live all the magic we made  
And bring on all the pretenders  
I'm not afraid  
Long live all the mountains we moved  
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you  
I was screaming long live that look on your face  
And bring on all the pretenders  
One day, we will be remembered  
  
[Verse 3]  
Hold on to spinning around  
Confetti falls to the ground  
May these memories break our fall  
  
Will you take a moment, promise me this  
That you'll stand by me forever  
But if God forbid fate should step in  
And force us into a goodbye  
If you have children some day  
When they point to the pictures  
Please tell them my name  
Tell them how the crowds went wild  
Tell them how I hope they shine  
  
[Chorus]  
Long live the walls we crashed through  
I had the time of my life, with you  
Long, long live the walls we crashed through  
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  
I was screaming long live all the magic we made  
And bring on all the pretenders  
I'm not afraid  
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved  
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you  
And long, long live that look on your face  
And bring on all the pretenders  
One day, we will be remembered

title: Last Kiss

[Verse 1]  
I still remember the look on your face  
Lit through the darkness at 1:58  
The words that you whispered  
For just us to know  
You told me you loved me  
So why did you go away?  
Away  
  
I do recall now the smell of the rain  
Fresh on the pavement  
I ran off the plane  
That July 9th  
The beat of your heart  
It jumps through your shirt  
I can still feel your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
But now I'll go sit on the floor  
Wearing your clothes  
All that I know is  
I don't know how to be something you miss  
I never thought we'd have a last kiss  
Never imagined we'd end like this  
Your name, forever the name on my lips  
  
[Verse 2]  
I do remember the swing of your step  
The life of the party, you're showing off again  
And I roll my eyes and then  
You pull me in  
I'm not much for dancing  
But for you I did  
  
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father  
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets  
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something  
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep  
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe  
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are  
Hope it's nice where you are  
  
And I hope the sun shines  
And it's a beautiful day  
And something reminds you  
You wish you had stayed  
You can plan for a change in weather and time  
But I never planned on you changing your mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just like our last kiss  
Forever the name on my lips  
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last

It's getting dark and it's all too quiet  
And I can't trust anything now  
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Whoa holding my breath  
Won't loose you again  
Something's made your eyes go cold

Something's gone terribly wrong  
You're all I wanted  
Cmon cmon don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Can't breathe whenever you're gone  
Can't turn back now I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away  
From everything we had  
But I still mean every word I said to you  
He will try to take away my pain  
And he just might make me smile  
But the whole time I'm wishing it was you instead

Oh holding my breath  
Won't see you again  
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

I guess you really did it this time  
Left yourself in your warpath  
Lost your balance on a tightrope  
Lost your mind trying to get it back  
  
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?  
Always a bigger bed to crawl into  
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything  
And everybody believed in you?  
  
[Hook]  
It's alright, just wait and see  
Your string of lights is still bright to me  
Oh, who you are is not where you've been  
You're still an innocent  
You're still an innocent  
  
[Verse 2]  
Did some things you can't speak of  
But at night you live it all again  
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now  
If only you had seen what you know now then  
  
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?  
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you  
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep  
Before the monsters caught up to you?  
  
[Hook]  
It's alright, just wait and see  
Your string of lights is still bright to me  
Ohwho you are is not where you've been  
You're still an innocent  
It's okay, life is a tough crowd  
32, and still growing up now  
Who you are is not what you did  
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers  
You'll have new Septembers  
Every one of us has messed up too  
Lives change like the weather  
I hope you remember  
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's alright, just wait and see  
Your string of lights is still bright to me  
Oh, who you are is not where you've been

title: Better Than Revenge

[Intro]  
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did  
Ha, Time for a little revenge  
  
[Verse 1]  
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer  
And, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him  
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause  
She took him faster than you can say sabotage  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it  
I underestimated just who I was dealing with  
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum  
She underestimated just who she was stealing from  
  
[Chorus]  
She's not a saint and she's not what you think  
She's an actress, whoa  
She's better known for the things that she does  
On the mattress, whoa  
Soon she's gonna find  
Stealing other people's toys on the playground  
Won't make you many friends  
She should keep in mind  
She should keep in mind  
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!  
  
[Verse 2]  
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list  
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it  
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling  
And, she thinks I'm psycho  
Cause I like to rhyme her name with things  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know  
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go  
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school  
So it's up to me  
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey  
You might have him, but haven't you heard  
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey  
You might have him, but I always get the last word  
Whoa!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing  
Cause I don't think you do, oh  
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing  
I don't think you do, I don't think you do  
Let's hear the applause  
C'mon show me how much better you are  
See you deserve some applause  
Cause you're so much better  
She took him faster than you could say sabotage!

title: Enchanted

[Verse 1]  
There I was again tonight  
Forcing laughter, faking smiles  
Same old tired, lonely place  
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy  
Vanished when I saw your face  
All I can say is  
It was enchanting to meet you  
  
Your eyes whispered "have we met?"  
Across the room your silhouette  
Starts to make its way to me  
The playful conversation starts  
Counter all your quick remarks  
Like passing notes in secrecy  
And it was  
Enchanting to meet you  
All I can say is  
It was enchanting to meet you  
  
[Hook]  
This night is sparkling  
Don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck  
Blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever  
Wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
[Verse 2]  
The lingering question kept me up  
2AM, who do you love?  
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake  
And now I'm pacing back and forth  
Wishing you were at my door  
I'd open up and you would say "hey"  
It was  
Enchanting to meet you  
All I know I was  
Enchanted to meet you  
  
[Hook]  
This night is sparkling  
Don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck  
Blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever  
Wondering if you knew  
  
This night is flawless  
Don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck  
Dancing around all alone  
I'll spend forever  
Wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
[Bridge]  
This is me praying that  
This was the very first page  
Not where the storyline ends  
My thoughts will echo your name  
Until I see you again  
This are the words I held back  
As I was leaving too soon  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
[Verse 3]  
Please don't be in love  
With someone else  
Please don't have somebody  
Waiting on you  
Please don't be in love  
With someone else  
Please don't have somebody  
Waiting on you  
  
[Hook]  
This night is sparkling  
Don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck  
Blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever  
Wondering if you knew  
  
This night is flawless  
Don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck  
Dancing around all alone  
I'll spend forever  
Wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
[Outro]  
Please don't be in love  
With someone else  
Please don't have somebody  
Waiting on you

title: Never Grow Up

[Verse 1]  
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger  
And it's so quiet in the world tonight  
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming  
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light  
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret  
I'd give all I have, honey  
If you could stay like that  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple  
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart  
And no one will desert you  
Just try to never grow up, never grow up  
  
[Verse 2]  
You're in the car on the way to the movies  
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off  
At 14 there's just so much you can't do  
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots  
But don't make her drop you off around the block  
Remember that she's getting older too  
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for
school  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple  
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred  
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up  
  
[Verse 3]  
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room  
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home  
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said  
And all your little brother's favorite songs  
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone  
  
So here I am in my new apartment  
In a big city, they just dropped me off  
It's so much colder that I thought it would be  
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on  
  
Wish I'd never grown up  
I wish I'd never grown up  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up  
I could still be little  
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up  
It could still be simple  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little  
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up  
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple  
Won't let nobody hurt you  
Won't let no one break your heart  
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up  
Oh, don't you ever grow up  
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

title: The Story of Us

[Verse 1]  
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us  
How we met  
And the sparks flew instantly  
And people would say they're the lucky ones  
  
I used to know my place was a spot next to you  
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat  
Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on  
  
Oh, a simple complication  
Miscommunications lead to fallout  
So many things that I wish you knew  
So many walls up that I can't break through  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me?  
Yeah  
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down  
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  
  
[Verse 2]  
Next chapter  
  
How'd we end up this way?  
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy  
And you're doing your best to avoid me  
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us  
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here  
But you held your pride like you should have held me  
Oh I'm scared to see the ending why are we pretending this is nothing  
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how  
I've never heard silence quite this loud  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me?  
Yeah  
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down  
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  
  
[Verse 3]  
This is looking like a contest  
Of who can act like they care less  
But I liked it better when you were on my side  
  
The battle's in your hands now  
But I would lay my armor down  
If you say you'd rather love than fight  
  
So many things that you wish I knew  
But the story of us might be ending soon  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me?  
Yeah  
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down  
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  
Now, Now, Now  
  
[Outro]  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me?  
Yeah  
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, because we're going down  
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  
The End

title: Mean

[Verse 1]  
You, with your words like knives  
And swords and weapons that you use against me  
You have knocked me off my feet again  
Got me feeling like I'm nothing  
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard  
Calling me out when I'm wounded  
You, picking on the weaker man  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
But you can take me down with just one single blow  
But you don't know what you don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean  
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean  
Why you gotta be so mean?  
  
[Verse 2]  
You, with your switching sides  
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation  
You have pointed out my flaws again  
As if I don't already see them  
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out  
Cause I'll never impress you  
I just want to feel okay again  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
I'll bet you got pushed around  
Somebody made you cold  
But the cycle ends right now  
Cause you can't lead me down that road  
And you don't know what you don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
And I can see you years from now in a bar  
Talking over a football game  
With that same big loud opinion  
But nobody's listening  
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things  
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing  
But all you are is mean  
  
[Interlude]  
All you are is mean  
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life  
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean  
  
But someday I'll be living in a big old city  
And all you're ever going to be is mean, yeah!  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me  
And all you're ever going to be is mean  
Why you gotta be so mean?  
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city  
(Why you gotta be so mean?)  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean  
(Why you gotta be so mean?)  
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me  
(Why you gotta be so mean?)  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean  
Why you gotta be so mean?

title: Dear John

[Verse 1]  
Long were the nights when  
My days once revolved around you  
Counting my footsteps  
Praying the floor wont fall through, again  
My mother accused me of losing my mind  
But I swore I was fine  
  
You paint me a blue sky  
And go back and turn it to rain  
And I lived in your chess game  
But you changed the rules everyday  
Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight  
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why  
  
[Chorus]  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young  
To be messed with  
The girl in the dress  
Cried the whole way home, I should've known  
  
[Verse 2]  
Well maybe its me  
And my blind optimism to blame  
Or maybe its you and your sick need  
To give love and take it away  
  
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand  
And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said  
'Run as fast as you can  
  
[Chorus]  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young  
To be messed with  
The girl in the dress  
Cried the whole way home  
  
[Chorus]  
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong  
Dont you think nineteens too young?  
To be played by your dark, twisted games  
When I loved you so, I should've known  
  
[Verse 3]  
You are an expert at sorry  
And keeping the lines blurry  
Never impressed by me acing your tests  
All the girls that you run dry have tired lifeless eyes  
Cause you burned them out  
  
But I took your matches  
Before fire could catch me  
So dont look now  
Im shining like fireworks  
Over your sad empty town  
  
[Chorus]  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young  
To be messed with  
The girl in the dress  
Cried the whole way home  
  
[Verse 4]  
I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young  
To be messed with  
The girl in the dress  
Wrote you a song, you shouldve known  
  
[Outro]  
You shouldve known  
Dont you think I was too young  
You shouldve known

title: Speak Now

I am not the kind of girl  
Who should be rudely barging in  
On a white veil occasion  
But you are not the kind of boy  
Who should be marrying the wrong girl  
  
I sneak in and see your friends  
And her snotty little family  
All dressed in pastel  
  
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid  
Somewhere back inside a room  
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry  
  
This is surely not  
What you thought it would be  
I lose myself in a daydream  
Where I stand and say  
  
Don't say yes, run away now  
I'll meet you when you're out  
Of the church at the back door  
  
Don't wait or say a single vow  
You need to hear me out  
And they said "speak now"  
  
Fond gestures are exchanged  
And the organ starts to play  
A song that sounds like a death march  
  
And I am hiding in the curtains  
It seems that I was uninvited  
By your lovely bride-to-be  
  
She floats down the aisle  
Like a pageant queen  
But I know you wish it was me  
You wish it was me (Don't 'cha)  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Oh Oh Oh! ( said speak now)  
  
I hear the preacher say  
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"  
There's the silence, there's my last chance  
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me  
  
Horrified looks from  
Everyone in the room  
But I'm only looking at you  
  
I am not the kind of girl  
Who should be rudely barging in  
On a white veil occasion  
But you are not the kind of boy  
Who should be marrying the wrong girl  
  
( Ha! )  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you say  
"Let's run away now  
I'll meet you when  
I'm out of my tux at the back door"  
  
Baby, I didn't say my vows  
So glad you were around when they said  
"Speak now"

title: Back To December

[Verse 1]  
I'm so glad you made time to see me  
How's life, tell me, how's your family  
I haven't seen them in a while  
You've been good, busier than ever  
We small talk, work and the weather  
Your guard is up and I know why  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
Cause the last time you saw me  
Is still burned in the back of your mind  
You gave me roses and I left them there to die  
  
[Chorus]  
So this is me swallowing my pride  
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night  
And I'd go back to December all the time  
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine  
  
[Post-Chorus 1]  
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright  
I go back to December all the time  
  
[Verse 2]  
These days I haven't been sleeping  
Staying up playing back myself leaving  
When your birthday passed and I didn't call  
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times  
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and  
Realized I loved you in the fall  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind  
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Post-Chorus 2]  
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind  
I go back to December all the time  
  
[Bridge]  
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right  
And how you held me in your arms that September night  
The first time you ever saw me cry  
Maybe this is wishful thinking  
Probably mindless dreaming  
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right  
  
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't  
So if the chain is on your door, I understand  
  
[Interlude]  
But this is me swallowing my pride  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night  
And I'd go back to December...  
  
[Chorus 2]  
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine  
  
[Post-Chorus 3]  
And I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright  
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind  
I go back to December all the time  
  
[Outro]  
All the time

title: Sparks Fly

[Verse 1]  
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm  
And I'm a house of cards  
You're the kind of reckless  
That should send me running  
But I kinda know that I won't get far  
And you stood there in front of me  
Just close enough to touch  
Close enough to hope you couldn't see  
What I was thinking of  
  
[Chorus]  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile  
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down  
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around  
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
[Verse 2]  
My mind forgets to remind me  
You're a bad idea  
You touch me once and it's really something  
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be  
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world  
But with you I know it's no good  
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild  
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel
right  
And lead me up the staircase  
Won't you whisper soft and slow?  
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
And the sparks fly  
Oh, baby, smile  
And the sparks fly

title: Mine

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables  
Left a small town and never looked back  
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling  
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts  
  
I say, "Can you believe it?"  
As we're lying on the couch  
The moment, I could see it  
Yes, yes, I can see it now  
  
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?  
You put your arm around me for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing that's ever been mine  
  
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together  
And there's a drawer of my things at your place  
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded  
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  
  
But we got bills to pay  
We got nothing figured out  
When it was hard to take  
Yes, yes  
  
This is what I thought about:  
  
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?  
You put your arm around me for the first time  
  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing that's ever been mine  
  
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?  
You saw me start to believe for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing that's ever been mine  
  
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM  
You said everything was slipping right out of our hands  
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street  
  
Braced myself for the goodbye, because that's all I've ever known  
Then, you took me by surprise  
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."  
  
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water  
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time  
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter  
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."  
  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And you cant see me wanting you the way you want her  
But you are everything to me

Miracle  
Unbelievable

That cant help but shine through

And everything that we could be

I just want to show you  
She dont even know you  
Baby, let me love you

title: I'm Only Me When I'm With You

[Verse 1]  
Friday night beneath the stars  
In a field behind your yard  
You and I are painting pictures in the sky  
And sometimes we don't say a thing  
Just listen to the crickets sing  
Everything I need is right here by my side  
And I know everything about you  
I don't wanna live without you  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm only up when you're not down  
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground  
It's like no matter what I do  
Well you drive me crazy half the time  
The other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true  
And I'm only me when I'm with you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Just a small town boy and girl  
Living in a crazy world  
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true  
And I don't try to hide my tears  
The secrets or my deepest fears  
Through it all nobody gets me like you do  
And you know everything about me  
You say that you can't live without me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself  
Only you can tell  
  
[Chorus]  
That I'm only up when you're not down  
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground  
It's like no matter what I do  
Well you drive me crazy half the time  
The other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true  
And I'm only me  
Who I wanna be  
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you  
With you  
Uh huh  
Yeah

title: Our Song

[Verse 1]  
I was riding shotgun  
With my hair undone  
In the front seat of his car  
He's got a one-hand feel  
On the steering wheel  
The other on my heart  
I look around, turn the radio down  
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"  
I say, "Nothing  
I was just thinking  
How we don't have a song"  
And he says  
  
[Chorus]  
Our song is the slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow  
Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
Our song is the way you laugh  
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"  
And when I got home 'fore I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was walking up  
The front porch steps  
After everything that day  
Had gone all wrong  
And been trampled on  
And lost and thrown away  
Got to the hallway  
Well on my way  
To my lovin' bed  
I almost didn't notice  
All the roses  
And the note that said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
I've heard every album, listened to the radio  
Waited for something to come along  
That was as good as our song  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause our song is the slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window  
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow  
Cause it's late and his mama don't know  
Our song is the way he laughs  
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"  
And when I got home 'fore I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
Play it again  
  
[Verse 4]  
I was riding shotgun  
With my hair undone  
In the front seat of his car  
I grabbed a pen  
And an old napkin  
And I wrote down our song

title: Mary's Song (Oh My My My)

[Verse 1]  
She said, I was seven and you were nine  
I looked at you like the stars that shined  
In the sky, the pretty lights  
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us  
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled  
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree  
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me  
You never did, you never did  
Take me back when our world was one block wide  
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried  
Just two kids, you and I  
Oh my my my my  
  
[Verse 2]  
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly  
I wasn't that little girl you used to see  
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights  
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us  
They never believed we'd really fall in love  
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes  
And said oh my my my  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up  
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me  
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight  
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight  
You stayed outside till the morning light  
Oh my my my my  
  
[Verse 3]  
A few years had gone and come around  
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town  
And you looked at me, got down on one knee  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle  
Our whole town came and our mamas cried  
You said I do and I did too  
Take me home where we met so many years before  
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch  
After all this time, you and I  
  
[Outro]  
I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine  
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine  
In the sky, oh my my my

title: Should've Said No

[Verse 1]  
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing  
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone  
Yesterday I found out about you  
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong  
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance  
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"  
  
[Chorus]  
You should've said, "No", you should've gone home  
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go  
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her  
Get back to me (get back to me)  
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind  
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"  
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet  
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me  
  
[Verse 2]  
You can see that I've been crying  
Baby you know all the right things to say  
But do you honestly expect me to believe  
We could ever be the same?  
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance  
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
I can't resist  
Before you go tell me this  
Was it worth it?  
Was she worth this?  
  
No no, no, no  
  
[Chorus]

title: Stay Beautiful

[Verse 1]  
Cory's eyes are like a jungle  
He smiles, it's like the radio  
He whispers songs into my window  
In words that nobody knows  
These pretty girls on every corner  
They watch him as he's walking home  
Saying, "Does he know?"  
Will you ever know?  
  
[Chorus]  
You're beautiful  
Every little piece love  
And don't you know  
You're really gonna be someone  
Ask anyone  
And when you find everything you looked for  
I hope your love will lead you back to my door  
Oh, but if it don't  
Stay beautiful  
  
[Verse 2]  
Cory finds another way to be  
The highlight of my day  
I'm taking pictures in my mind  
So I can save them for a rainy day  
It's hard to make a conversation  
When he's taking my breath away  
I should say, hey, by the way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
If you and I are a story  
That never gets told  
If what you are is a daydream  
I'll never get to hold  
At least you'll know  
  
[Chorus]  
You're beautiful  
Every little piece love  
And don't you know  
You're really gonna be someone  
Ask anyone  
And when you find everything you looked for  
I hope your life leads you back to my front door  
Oh, but if it don't  
Will you stay  
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful  
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful  
La la la  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, but if it don't  
Stay beautiful  
Stay beautiful  
Na, na, na, na, na

title: Tied Together With A Smile

[Verse 1]  
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty  
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you  
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty  
But that's not true, cause I know you  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold on, baby, you're losing it  
The water's high, you're jumping into it  
And letting go and no one knows  
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone  
That you might not be the golden one  
And you're tied together with a smile  
But you're coming undone  
  
[Verse 2]  
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted  
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change  
Hoping it will end up in his pocket  
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain  
Oh, cause it's not his price to pay  
Not his price to pay  
  
[Chorus][x2]  
  
[Outro]  
You're tied together with a smile  
But you're coming undone oh  
Goodbye, baby  
With a smile, baby, baby

title: The Outside

[Verse 1]  
I didn't know what I would find  
When I went looking for a reason, I know  
I didn't read between the lines  
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go  
I tried to take the road less traveled by  
But nothing seems to work the first few times  
Am I right?  
  
[Chorus]  
So how can I ever try to be better?  
Nobody ever lets me in  
I can still see you, this ain't the best view  
On the outside looking in  
I've been a lot of lonely places  
I've never been on the outside  
  
[Verse 2]  
You saw me there, but never knew  
I would give it all up to be  
A part of this, a part of you  
And now it's all too late so you see  
You could've helped if you had wanted to  
But no one notices until it's too  
Late to do anything

title: Cold As You

[Verse 1]  
You have a way of coming easily to me  
And when you take, you take the very best of me  
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something  
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day  
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say  
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through  
I've never been anywhere cold as you  
  
[Verse 2]  
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray  
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away  
And you come away with a great little story  
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you  
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you  
(Died for you)  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day  
Every smile you fake is so condescending  
Counting all the scars you made  
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through  
I've never been anywhere cold as you

title: A Place In This World

[Verse 1]  
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me  
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out  
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking  
Trying to see through the rain coming down  
Even though I'm not the only one  
Who feels the way I do  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know  
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on  
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world  
  
[Verse 2]  
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans  
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve  
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine  
Could you tell me what more do I need  
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah  
But that's OK  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission  
But I'm ready to fly  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know  
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on  
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know  
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl  
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh

title: Teardrops on my Guitar

[Verse 1]  
Drew looks at me  
I fake a smile so he won't see  
But I want and I'm needing  
Everything that we should be  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
I'll bet she's beautiful  
That girl he talks about  
And she's got everything that I have to live without  
  
[Verse 2]  
Drew talks to me  
I laugh because it's just so funny  
But I can't even see  
Anyone when he's with me  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right  
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night  
  
[Chorus]  
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star  
He's the song in the car  
I keep singing, don't know why I do...  
  
[Verse 2]  
Drew walks by me  
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?  
And there he goes, so perfectly  
The kind of flawless I wish I could be  
  
[Pre-Chorus 3]  
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love  
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light  
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight  
  
[Chorus]

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough  
And he's all that I need to fall into  
Drew looks at me  
I fake a smile so he won't see

title: Picture To Burn

[Verse 1]  
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy  
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me  
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy  
That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!  
  
By the way  
  
[Chorus]  
I hate that stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn  
  
[Verse 2]  
There's no time for tears  
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge  
There's nothing stopping me  
From going out with all of your best friends  
And if you come around saying sorry to me  
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
And if you're missing me  
You'd better keep it to yourself  
Cause coming back around here  
Would be bad for your health  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
In case you haven't heard  
I really really hate that

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn  
You're just another picture to burn  
Baby, burn

title: Tim McGraw

[Verse 1]  
He said the way my blue eyes shined  
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night  
I said: "That's a lie."  
  
Just a boy in a Chevy truck  
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck  
On backroads at night  
  
And I was right there beside him all summer long  
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone  
  
But when you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think my favorite song  
The one we danced to all night long  
The moon like a spotlight on the lake  
  
[Chorus]  
When you think happiness  
I hope you think that little black dress  
Think of my head on your chest  
And my old faded blue jeans  
  
When you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think of me  
  
[Verse 2]  
September saw a month of tears  
And thankin' God that you weren't here  
To see me like that  
  
But in a box beneath my bed  
Is a letter that you never read  
From three summers back  
  
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet  
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe  
  
When you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think my favorite song  
The one we danced to all night long  
The moon like a spotlight on the lake  
  
[Chorus]  
When you think happiness  
I hope you think that little black dress  
Think of my head on your chest  
And my old faded blue jeans  
  
When you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think of me  
  
[Verse 3]  
And I'm back for the first time since then  
I'm standin' on your street  
And there's a letter left on your doorstep  
And the first thing that you'll read is:  
  
When you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think my favorite song  
Someday you'll turn your radio on  
I hope it takes you back to that place  
  
[Chorus]  
When you think happiness  
I hope you think that little black dress  
Think of my head on your chest  
And my old faded blue jeans  
  
When you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think of me  
  
Oh, think of me  
Mmmm

There's something 'bout the way  
The street looks when it's just rained  
There's a glow off the pavement  
You walk me to the car  
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there  
In the middle of the parking lot  
Yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
We're driving down the road  
I wonder if you know  
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now  
But you're just so cool  
Run your hands through your hair  
Absent mindedly making me want you  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't know how it gets better than this  
You take my hand and drag me head first  
Fearless  
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress  
Fearless  
  
[Verse 2]  
So baby drive slow  
'til we run out of road in this one horse town  
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat  
You put your eyes on me  
In this moment now capture it, remember it  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I don't know how it gets better than this  
You take my hand and drag me head first  
Fearless  
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress  
Fearless  
Uh oh  
  
[Verse 3]  
Well you stood there with me in the doorway  
My hands shake  
I'm not usually this way but  
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave  
It's the first kiss  
It's flawless  
Really something  
It's fearless  
Oh yeah  
  
[Chorus][x2]  
Cause I don't know how it gets better than this  
You take my hand and drag me head first  
Fearless  
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress  
Fearless

title: The Other Side Of The Door

[Verse 1]  
In the heat of the fight I walked away  
Ignoring words that you were saying  
Trying to make me stay  
I said, 'This time I've had enough'  
And you've called a hundred times  
But I'm not picking up  
Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over  
But if you look a little closer  
  
[Chorus]  
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
[Verse 2]  
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone  
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone  
I keep going back over things we both said  
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread  
So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see  
When I left I wanted you to chase after me  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
[Verse 3]  
And I'll scream out the window  
I can't even look at you  
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do  
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right  
I mean it, I mean it"  
What I mean is

I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
[Verse 4]  
With your face and the beautiful eyes  
And the conversation with the little white lies  
And the faded picture of a beautiful night  
You carry me from your car to the stairs  
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?  
After everything and that little black dress  
After everything I must confess, I need you

There arent nothing more right babe  
Misty morning comes again and I can't

title: Forever & Always (Piano Version)

[Verse 1]  
Once upon a time  
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye  
And we caught onto something  
I hold onto the night  
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me  
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me  
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak  
I don't feel welcome anymore  
Baby, what happened, please tell me  
Cause one second it was perfect  
Now you're half way out the door  
  
[Chorus]  
And I stare at the phone  
He still hasn't called  
And then you feel so low  
You can't feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to  
When he said forever and always  
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here  
And it rains when you're gone  
I was there when you said forever and always  
  
[Verse 2]  
Was I out of line?  
Did I say something way too honest?  
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy  
I looked into your eyes  
Thought I knew for a minute now I'm not so sure  
So here's to everything coming down to nothing  
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core  
Where is this going?  
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
And I stare at the phone  
He still hasn't called  
And then you feel so low  
You can't feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to  
When he said forever and always  
And it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here  
And it rains when you're gone  
I was there when you said forever and always  
  
[Bridge]  
You didn't mean it baby  
I don't this so, oh oh oh  
Back up, baby back up  
Did you forget everything?  
Back up, baby back up  
Did you forget everything?  
  
Back up, baby back up  
Please back up, oh back up  
Back up, baby back up  
  
Cause it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here  
And it rains when you're gone  
I was there when you said forever and always  
  
[Chorus]  
And I stare at the phone  
He still hasn't called  
And then you feel so low  
You can't feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to  
When we said forever and always  
Cause it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here  
And it rains when you're gone  
I was there when you said forever and always  
  
[Outro]  
You didn't mean it baby  
You said forever and always, yeah

title: Untouchable

[Verse]  
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky  
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell  
You why  
I'm caught up in you, I'm  
Caught up in you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun  
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone  
  
[Chorus]  
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream  
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name  
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven  
  
It's half full and I won't wait here all day  
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway  
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun  
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone  
  
[Chorus]  
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream  
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name  
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
In the middle of the night waking from this dream  
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me  
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm caught up in you  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But youre untouchable, burning brighter than the sun  
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone  
  
[Chorus]  
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream  
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name  
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream  
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name  
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on, come on  
  
[Chorus]  
In the middle of the night waking from this dream  
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me  
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together  
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven  
  
[Chorus]  
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream  
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name  
You got to come on, come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Outro]  
Like a million little stars spelling out your name  
They're spelling out your name, oh
